And now to-day, in the hope and with the object that this religious celebration shall be more devoutly performed, We have traced and recommended a striking design from which, if all shall follow it out with hearty good will, We not unreasonably expect extraordinary and lasting benefits for Christendom in the first place and also for the whole human race.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">2. Already more than once We have endeavored, after the example of Our predecessors Innocent XII, Benedict XIII, Clement XIII, Pius VI, and Pius IX., devoutly to foster and bring out into fuller light that most excellent form of devotion which has for its object the veneration of the Sacred Heart of Jesus; this We did especially by the Decree given on June 28, 1889, by which We raised the Feast under that name to the dignity of the first class. But now We</font> <font size=\"3\">have in mind a more signal form of devotion which shall be in a manner the crowning perfection of all the honors that people have been accustomed to pay to the Sacred Heart, and which We confidently trust will be most pleasing to Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. This is not the first time, however, that the design of which We speak has been mooted. Twenty-five years ago, on the approach of the solemnities of the second centenary of the Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque's reception of the Divine command to propagate the worship of the Sacred Heart, many letters from all parts, not merely from private persons but from Bishops also were sent to Pius IX. begging that he would consent to consecrate the whole human race to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus. It was thought best at the time to postpone the matter in order that a well-considered decision might be arrived at. Meanwhile permission was granted to individual cities which desired it thus to consecrate themselves, and a form of consecration was drawn up. Now, for certain new and additional reasons, We consider that the plan is ripe for fulfilment.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">3. This world-wide and solemn testimony of allegiance and piety is especially appropriate to Jesus Christ, who is the Head and Supreme Lord of the race. His empire extends not only over Catholic nations and those who, having been duly washed in the waters of holy baptism, belong of right to the Church, although erroneous opinions keep them astray, or dissent from her teaching cuts them off from her care; it comprises also all those who are deprived of the Christian faith, so that the whole human race is most truly under the power of Jesus Christ. For He who is the Only-begotten Son of God the Father, having the same substance with Him and being the brightness of His glory and the figure of His substance (Hebrews i., 3) necessarily has everything in common with the Father, and therefore sovereign power over all things. This is why the Son of God thus speaks of Himself through the Prophet: \"But I am appointed king by him over Sion, his holy mountain. . . The Lord said to me, Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession\" (Psalm, ii.). By these words He declares that He has power from God over the whole Church, which is signified by Mount Sion, and also over the rest of the world to its uttermost ends. On what foundation this sovereign power rests is made sufficiently plain by the words, \"Thou art My Son.\" For by the very fact that He is the Son of the King of all, He is also the heir of all His Father's power: hence the words-\"I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance,\" which are similar to those used by Paul the Apostle, \"whom he bath appointed heir of all things\" (Hebrews i., 2).</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">4. But we should now give most special consideration to the declarations made by Jesus Christ, not through the Apostles or the Prophets but by His own words. To the Roman Governor who asked Him, \"Art thou a king then?\" He answered unhesitatingly, \"Thou sayest that I am a king\" (John xviii. 37). And the greatness of this power and the boundlessness of His kingdom is still more clearly declared in these words to the Apostles: \"All power is given to me in heaven and on earth\" (Matthew xxviii., 18). If then all power has been given to Christ it follows of necessity that His empire must be supreme, absolute and independent of the will of any other, so that none is either equal or like unto it: and since it has been given in heaven and on earth it ought to have heaven and earth obedient to it. And verily he has acted on this extraordinary and peculiar right</font> <font size=\"3\">when He commanded His Apostles to preach His doctrine over the earth, to gather all men together into the one body of the Church by the baptism of salvation, and to bind them by laws, which no one could reject without risking his eternal salvation.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">5. But this is not all. Christ reigns nor only by natural right as the Son of God, but also by a right that He has acquired. For He it was who snatched us \"from the power of darkness\" (Colossians i., 13), and \"gave Himself for the redemption of all\" (I Timothy ii., 6). Therefore not only Catholics, and those who have duly received Christian baptism, but also all men, individually and collectively, have become to Him \"a purchased people\" (I Peter ii., 9). St. Augustine's words are therefore to the point when he says: \"You ask what price He paid? See what He gave and you will understand how much He paid. The price was the blood of Christ. What could cost so much but the whole world, and all its people? The great price He paid was paid for all\" (T. 120 on St. John).</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">6. How it comes about that infidels themselves are subject to the power and dominion of Jesus Christ is clearly shown by St. Thomas, who gives us the reason and its explanation. For having put the question whether His judicial power extends to all men, and having stated that judicial authority flows naturally from royal authority, he concludes decisively as follows: \"All things are subject to Christ as far as His power is concerned, although they are not all subject to Him in the exercise of that power\" (3a., p., q. 59, a. 4). This sovereign power of Christ over men is exercised by truth, justice, and above all, by charity.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">7. To this twofold ground of His power and domination He graciously allows us, if we think fit, to add voluntary consecration. Jesus Christ, our God and our Redeemer, is rich in the fullest and perfect possession of all things: we, on the other hand, are so poor and needy that we have nothing of our own to offer Him as a gift. But yet, in His infinite goodness and love, He in no way objects to our giving and consecrating to Him what is already His, as if it were really our own; nay, far from refusing such an offering, He positively desires it and asks for it: \"My son, give me thy heart.\" We are, therefore, able to be pleasing to Him by the good will and the affection of</font> <font size=\"3\">our soul. For by consecrating ourselves to Him we not only declare our open and free acknowledgment and acceptance of His authority over us, but we also testify that if what we offer as a gift were really our own, we would still offer it with our whole heart. We also beg of Him that He would vouchsafe to receive it from us, though clearly His own. Such is the efficacy of the act of which We speak, such is the meaning underlying Our words.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">8. And since there is in the Sacred Heart a symbol and a sensible image of the infinite love of Jesus Christ which moves us to love one another, therefore is it fit and proper that we should consecrate ourselves to His most Sacred Heart-an act which is nothing else than an offering and a binding of oneself to Jesus Christ, seeing that whatever honor, veneration and love is given to this divine Heart is really and truly given to Christ Himself.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">9. For these reasons We urge and exhort all who know and love this divine Heart willingly to undertake this act of piety; and it is Our earnest desire that all should make it on the same day, that so the aspirations of so many thousands who are performing this act of consecration may be borne to the temple of heaven on the same day. But shall We allow to slip from Our remembrance those innumerable others upon whom the light of Christian truth has not yet shined? We hold the place of Him who came to save that which was lost, and who shed His blood for the salvation of the whole human race. And so We greatly desire to bring to the true life those who sit in the shadow of death. As we have already sent messengers of Christ over the earth to instruct them, so now, in pity for their lot with all Our soul we commend them, and as far as in us lies We consecrate them to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. In this way this act of devotion, which We recommend, will be a blessing to all. For having performed it, those in whose hearts are the knowledge and love of Jesus Christ will feel that faith and love increased. Those who knowing Christ, yet neglect His law and its precepts, may still gain from His Sacred Heart the flame of charity. And lastly, for those still more unfortunate, who are struggling in the darkness of superstition, we shall all with one mind implore the assistance of heaven that Jesus Christ, to whose power they are subject, may also one day render them submissive to its exercise; and that</font> <font size=\"3\">not only in the life to come when He will fulfil His will upon all men, by saving some and punishing others, (St. Thomas, ibid), but also in this mortal life by giving them faith and holiness. May they by these virtues strive to honor God as they ought, and to win everlasting happiness in heaven.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">10. Such an act of consecration, since it can establish or draw tighter the bonds which naturally connect public affairs with God, gives to States a hope of better things. In these latter times especially, a policy has been followed which has resulted in a sort of wall being raised between the Church and civil society. In the constitution and administration of States the authority of sacred and divine law is utterly disregarded, with a view to the exclusion of religion from having any constant part in public life. This policy almost tends to the removal of the Christian faith from our midst, and, if that were possible, of the banishment of God Himself from the earth. When men's minds are raised to such a height of insolent pride, what wonder is it that the greater part of the human race should have fallen into such disquiet of mind and be buffeted by waves so rough that no one is suffered to be free from anxiety and peril? When religion is once discarded it follows of necessity that the surest foundations of the public welfare must give way, whilst God, to inflict on His enemies the punishment they so richly deserve, has left them the prey of their own evil desires, so that they give themselves up to their passions and finally wear themselves out by excess of liberty.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">11. Hence that abundance of evils which have now for a long time settled upon the world, and which pressingly call upon us to seek for help from Him by whose strength alone they can be driven away. Who can He be but Jesus Christ the Only-begotten Son of God? \"For there is no other name under heaven given to men whereby we must be saved\" (Acts iv., 12). We must have recourse to Him who is the Way, the Truth and the Life. We have gone astray and we must return to the right path: darkness has overshadowed our minds, and the gloom must be dispelled by the light of truth: death has seized upon us, and we must lay hold of life. It will at length be possible that our many wounds be healed and all justice spring forth again with the hope of restored authority; that the splendors of peace be renewed,</font> <font size=\"3\">and swords and arms drop from the hand when all men shall acknowledge the empire of Christ and willingly obey His word, and \"Every tongue shall confess that our Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father\" (Philippians ii, II).</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">12. When the Church, in the days immediately succeeding her institution, wasoppressed beneath the yoke of the Caesars, a young Emperor saw in the heavens across, which became at once the happy omen and cause of the glorious victorythat soon followed. And now, to-day, behold another blessed and heavenly tokenis offered to our sight-the most Sacred Heart of Jesus, with a cross rising fromit and shining forth with dazzling splendor amidst flames of love. In thatSacred Heart all our hopes should be placed, and from it the salvation of men isto be confidently besought.</font> </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">13. Finally, there is one motive which We are unwilling to pass over in silence, personal to Ourselves it is true, but still good and weighty, which moves Us to undertake this celebration. God, the author of every good, not long ago preserved Our life by curing Us of a dangerous disease. We now wish, by this increase of the honor paid to the Sacred Heart, that the memory of this great mercy should be brought prominently forward, and Our gratitude be publicly acknowledged.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">14. For these reasons, We ordain that on the ninth, tenth and eleventh of thecoming month</font><font size=\"3\">of June, in the principal church of every town and village, certain prayers besaid, and on each of these days there be added to the other prayers the Litanyof the Sacred Heart approved by Our authority. On the last day the form ofconsecration shall be recited which, Venerable Brethren, We sent to you withthese letters.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">15. As a pledge of divine benefits, and in token of Our paternal benevolence, toyou, and to the clergy and people committed to your care We lovingly grant inthe Lord the Apostolic Benediction.</font> </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\"><i>Given in Rome at St. Peter's on the 25th day of May, 1899, the twenty-second year of Our Pontificate.</i></font></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><font size=\"3\"><b>LEO XIII</b></font></p>\n<p align=\"center\"> </p>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\" size=\"3\">© Copyright 1899 - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><font size=\"3\"><i> </i></font></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"content parsys\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>",

MDCCCLXXXIX datum, quo scilicet Festum eo titulo ad ritum primae classis eveximus. Nunc vero luculentior quaedam obsequii forma obversatur animo, quae scilicet honorum omnium, quotquot Sacratissimo Cordi haberi consueverunt, velut absolutio perfectioque sit: eamque Iesu Christo Redemptori pergratam fore confidimus. Quamquam haec, de qua loquimur, haud sane nunc primum mota res est. Etenim abhinc quinque ferme lustris, cum saecularia solemnia imminerent iterum instauranda postea quam mandatum de cultu divini Cordis propagando beata Margarita Maria de Alacoque divinitus acceperat, libelli supplices non a privatis tantummodo, sed etiam ab Episcopis ad Pium IX in id undique missi complures, ut communitatem generis humani devovere augustissimo Cordi Iesu vellet. Differri placuit rem, quo decerneretur maturius: interim devovendi sese singillatim civitatibus data facultas volentibus, praescriptaque devotionis formula. Novis nunc accedentibus causis, maturitatem venisse rei perficiendae iudicamus.</p>\n<p>Atque amplissimum istud maximumque obsequii et pietatis testimonium omnino convenit Iesu Christo, quia ipse princeps est ac dominus summus. Videlicet imperium eius non est tantummodo in gentes catholici nominis, aut in eos solum, qui sacro baptismate rite abluti, utique ad Ecclesiam, si spectetur ius, pertinent, quamvis vel error opinionum devios agat, vel dissensio a caritate seiungat: sed complectitur etiam quotquot numerantur christianae fidei expertes, ita ut verissime in potestate Iesu Christi sit universitas generis humani. Nam qui Dei Patris Unigenitus est, eamdemque habet cum ipso substantiam, <i>splendor gloriae et figura substantiae eius </i>(<i>Hebr</i>. I. 3), huic omnia cum Patre communia esse necesse est, proptereaque quoque rerum omnium summum imperium. Ob eam rem Dei Filius de se ipse apud Prophetam, <i>Ego autem</i>, effatur, <i>constitutus sum rex super Sion montem sanctum eius. — Dominus dixit ad me: Filius meus es tu, ego hodie genui te. Postula a me, et dabo Tibi gentes hereditatem tuam et possessionem tuam terminos terrae</i> (<i>Ps</i>. II). Quibus declarat, se potestatem a Deo accepisse cum in omnem Ecclesiam quae per Sion montem intelligitur, tum in reliquum terrarum orbem, qua eius late termini proferuntur. Quo autem summa ista potestas fundamento nitatur, satis illa docent, <i>Filius meus es tu</i>. Hoc enim ipso quod omnium Regis est Filius, universae potestatis est heres: ex quo illa, <i>dabo Tibi gentes hereditatem tuam</i>. Quorum sunt ea similia, quae habet Paulus apostolus: <i>Quem constituit heredem universorum</i> (<i>Hebr</i>. I, 2).</p>\n<p>Illud autem considerandum maxime, quid affirmaverit de imperio suo Iesus Christus non iam per apostolos aut prophetas, sed suis ipse verbis. Quaerenti enim romano Praesidi: <i>ergo rex es tu </i>? sine ulla dubitatione respondit: <i>tu dicis quia rex sum ego</i> (<i>Ioan</i>. XVIII, 37). Atque huius magnitudinem potestatis et infinitatem regni illa ad Apostolos apertius confirmant: <i>Data est mihi omnis potestas in caelo et in terra</i> (<i>Matth</i>. XXVIII, 18). Si Christo data potestas omnis, necessario consequitur, imperium eius summum esse oportere, absolutum, arbitrio nullius obnoxium, nihil ut ei sit nec par nec simile: cumque data sit in caelo et in terra, debet sibi habere caelum terrasque parentia. Re autem vera ius istud singulare sibique proprium exercuit, iussis nimirum Apostolis evulgare doctrinam suam, congregare homines in unum corpus Ecclesiae per lavacrum salutis, leges denique imponere, quas recusare sine salutis sempiternae discrimine nemo posset.</p>\n<p>Neque tamen sunt in hoc omnia. Imperat Christus non iure tantum nativo, quippe Dei Unigenitus, sed etiam quaesito. Ipse enim eripuit nos <i>de potestate tenebrarum</i> (<i>Coloss</i>. I, 13), idemque<i> dedit redemptionem semetipsum pro omnibus</i> (1 <i>Tim</i>. II, 6). Ei ergo facti sunt <i>populus acquisitionis </i>(1 <i>Petr</i>. II, 9) non solum et catholici et quotquot christianum baptisma rite accepere, sed homines singuli et universi. Quam in rem apte Augustinus: <i>quaeritis</i>, inquit, <i>quid emeriti Videte quid dederit, et invenietis quid emerit. Sanguis Christi pretium est. Tanti quid valet?, quid, nisi totus mundus? quid, nisi omnes gentes? Pro toto dedit, quantum dedit</i> (Tract. 120 in Ioan.).</p>\n<p>Cur autem ipsi infideles potestate dominatuque Iesu Christi teneantur, caussam sanctus Thomas rationemque, edisserendo, docet. Cum enim de iudiciali eius potestate quaesisset, num ad homines porrigatur universos, affirmassetque, <i>iudiciaria potestas consequitur potestatem regiam</i>, plane concludit: <i>Christo omnia sunt subiecta quantum ad potestatem, etsi nondum sunt ei subiecta quantum ad executionem potestatis</i> (3 p. q. 39 a. 4). Quae Christi potestas et imperium in homines exercetur per veritatem, per iustitiam, maxime per caritatem.</p>\n<p>Verum ad istud potestatis dominationisque suae fundamentum duplex benigne ipse sinit ut accedat a nobis, si libet, devotio voluntaria. Porro Iesus Christus, Deus idem ac Redemptor, omnium est rerum cumulata perfectaque possessione locuples : nos autem adeo inopes atque egentes ut, quo eum munerari liceat, de nostro quidem suppetat nihil. Sed tamen pro summa bonitate et caritate sua minime recusat quin sibi, quod suum est, perinde demus, addicamus, ac iuris nostri foret: nec solum non recusat, sed expetit ac rogat:<i> Fili, praebe cor tuum mihi</i>. Ergo gratifican illi utique possumus voluntate atque affezione animi. Nam ipsi devovendo nos, non modo et agnoscimus et accipimus imperium eius aperte ac libenter: sed re ipsa testamur, si nostrum id esset quod dono damus, summa nos voluntate daturos; ac petere ab eo ut id ipsum, etsi plane suum, tamen accipere a nobis ne gravetur. Haec vis rei est, de qua agimus, haec Nostris subiecta verbis sententia. — Quoniamque inest in Sacro Corde symbolum atque expressa imago infinitae Iesu Christi caritatis, quae movet ipsa nos ad amandum mutuo, ideo consentaneum est dicare se Cordi eius augustissimo: quod tamen nihil est aliud quam dedere atque obligare se Iesu Christo, quia quidquid honoris, obsequii, pietatis divino Cordi tribuitur, vere et proprie Christo tribuitur ipsi.</p>\n<p>Itaque ad istiusmodi devotionem voluntate suscipiendam excitamus cohortamurque quotquot divinissimum Cor et noscant et diligant: ac valde velimus, eodem id singulos die efficere, ut tot millium idem voventium animorum significationes uno omnes tempore ad caeli templa pervehantur. — Verum numne elabi animo patiemur innumerabiles alios, quibus christiana veritas nondum affulsit? Atqui eius persona geritur a Nobis, qui venit salvum facere quod perierat, quique totius humani generis saluti addixit sanguinem suum. Propterea eos ipsos qui in umbra mortis sedent, quemadmodum excitare ad eam, quae vere vita est, assidue studemus, Christi nuntiis in omnes partes ad erudiendum dimissis, ita nunc, eorum miserati vicem, Sacratissimo Cordi Iesu commendamus maiorem in modum et, quantum in Nobis est, dedicamus. — Qua ratione haec, quam cunctis suademus, cunctis est profutura devotio. Hoc enim facto, in quibus est Iesu Christi cognitio et amor, ii facile sentient sibi fidem amoremque crescere. Qui, Christo cognito, praecepta tamen eius legemque negligunt, iis fas erit e Sacro Corde flammam caritatis arripere. Iis demum longe miseris, qui caeca superstitione conflictantur, caeleste auxilium uno omnes animo flagitabimus, ut eos Iesus Christus, sicut iam sibi habet subiectos <i>secundum potestatem</i>, subiiciat aliquando <i>secundum executionem potestatis</i>, neque solum <i>in futuro saeculo, quando de omnibus voluntatem suam implebit, quosdam quidem salvando, quosdam puniendo</i> (S. Tom. i. c. ), sed in hac etiam vita mortali, fidem scilicet ac sanctitatem impertiendo; quibus illi virtutibus colere Deum queant, uti par est, et ad sempiternam in caelo felicitatem contendere.</p>\n<p>Cuiusmodi dedicatio spem quoque civitatibus affert rerum meliorum, cum vincula instaurare aut firmius possit adstringere, quae res publicas natura iungunt Deo. — Novissimis hisce temporibus id maxime actum, ut Ecclesiam inter ac rem civilem quasi murus intersit. In constitutione atque administratione civitatum pro nihilo habetur sacri divinique iuris auctoritas, eo proposito ut communis vitae consuetudinem nulla vis religionis attingat. Quod huc ferme recidit, Christi fidem de medio tollere, ipsumque, si fieri posset, terris exigere Deum. Tanta insolentia elatis animis, quid mirum quod humana gens pleraque in eam inciderit rerum perturbationem iisque iactetur fluctibus, qui metu et periculo vacuum sinant esse neminem ? Certissima incolumitati publicae firmamenta dilabi necesse est, religione posthabita. Poenas autem Deus de perduellibus iustas meritasque sumpturus, tradidit eos suae ipsorum libidini, ut serviant cupiditatibus ac sese ipsi nimia libertate conficiant.</p>\n<p>Hinc vis illa maiorum quae iamdiu insident, quaeque vehementer postulant, ut unius auxilium exquiratur, cuius virtute depellantur. Quisnam autem ille sit, praeter Iesum Christum Unigenitum Dei? <i>Neque enim aliud nomen est sub caelo datum hominibus, in quo oporteat nos salvos fieri</i> (<i>Act</i>. IV, 12). Ad illum ergo confugiendum, qui est via, veritas et vita. Erratum est: redeundum in viam: obductae mentibus tenebrae: discutienda caligo luce veritatis: mors occupavit: apprehendenda vita. Tum denique licebit sanari tot vulnera, tum ius omne in pristinae auctoritatis spem revirescet, et restituentur ornamenta pacis, atque excident gladii fluentque arma de manibus, cum Christi imperium omnes accipient libentes eique parebunt, <i>atque omnis lingua</i> confitebitur <i>quia Dominus Iesus Christus in gloria est Dei Patris</i> (<i>Phil</i>.
