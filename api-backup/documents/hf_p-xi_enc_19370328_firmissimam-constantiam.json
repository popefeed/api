But unfortunately, the enemies of God and Christ have succeeded in overcoming many lukewarm and timid souls who, although they adore God in the intimacy of their consciences, nevertheless, either through human respect or through fear of earthly evils, have become, at least materially, cooperators in the dechristianization of a people that owes to religion its greatest glories.</p> <p align=\"left\">2. In contrast to these apostasies and weaknesses, which afflict Us profoundly, there appears to Us all the more praiseworthy and meritorious the resistance to evil, the practice of Christian life and the frank profession of faith by those most numerous Faithful whom you, Venerable Brethren, and with you your clergy, illuminate and guide with pastoral strength no less than with the splendid example of your life. This consoles Us in the midst of Our sorrow, and engenders in Us the hope for better days for the Mexican Church, which, re-animated by so much heroism and sustained by the prayers and sacrifices of so many elect souls, cannot perish, even more, it must flourish again more vigorously and more luxuriously.</p> <p align=\"left\">3. And precisely to revive your confidence in Divine Aid, and to encourage you to continue in the practice of a fervent Christian life, We address this letter to you, and We avail ourselves of this occasion to remind you how, under the present difficult circumstances, the most efficacious means for a Christian restoration are - and also among you - above all the holiness of priests, and in the second place the correct formation of the laity in order that they may be capable of cooperating fruitfully in the Apostolate of the Hierarchy, so much more necessary in Mexico both because of the vastness of the territory and because of other circumstances known to all.</p> <p align=\"left\">4. Our thought, therefore, is fixed in the first place on those who must be the light that illuminates, the salt which conserves, the good leaven which penetrates the entire mass of the Faithful: We mean your priests. In truth, We know how tenaciously and at the cost of how many sacrifices you care for the selection and increase of sacerdotal vocations, in the midst of all sorts of difficulties, well persuaded as you are thus to provide the solution of a vital problem, truly the most vital of all the problems relating to the future of the Church. In view of the almost absolute impossibility of having in your own country wellordered and tranquil seminaries, you have found in this city an ample and gracious refuge in the South American <i>Pio Latino</i> College, which has formed and continues to form in science and virtue so many worthy priests and which, for its precious work, is particularly dear to Us. But since in many cases it has been impossible to send your students to Rome, you have worked solicitously to find an asylum in the hospitality of a great neighboring nation.</p> <p align=\"left\">5. In congratulating you on this praiseworthy initiative which is already becoming a consoling reality, We again express Our gratitude to all those who have so generously tendered you hospitality and assistance. And with paternal instinct We remind you again on this occasion of Our precise wish that you make known and explain suitably, not only to the clerics, but to all your priests, Our Encyclical <i>Ad Catholici Sacerdotii</i>, which explains Our thoughts on this the gravest and most important among the grave and important subjects treated by Us.</p> <p align=\"left\">6. The Mexican priests thus formed according to the Heart of Jesus Christ will feel that in the actual conditions of their country (of which We spoke in Our Apostolic Letter <i>Paterna Sane Solicitudo</i> of February 2, 1926) - which are so similar to those of the early times of the Church, when the Apostles appealed for the collaboration of the laity - it would be very difficult to reconquer for Christ so many misguided souls without the providential assistance which the laity give by means of Catholic Action. More so since at times grace prepares among them generous souls ready to develop most fruitful activity if they encounter a learned and holy clergy capable of understanding and guiding them.</p> <p align=\"left\">7. Therefore, to the Mexican priests, who have dedicated their lives to the service of Jesus Christ, of the Church and of souls - to these We direct Our first and warmest appeal, that they will generously second Our and your solicitude for the progress of Catholic-Action, dedicating to it their best efforts and most opportune diligence. The methods of an effective collaboration of the laity with your action will never be lacking if the priests will devote themselves with careful attention to cultivating the Christian people by means of wise spiritual direction and careful religious instructions, not diluted in vain discourses, but nourished with sound doctrine taken from Holy Scripture and full of unction and of force.</p> <p align=\"left\">8. It is true that not all understand fully the necessity of this holy apostolate of the laity, although from Our first Encyclical, <i>Ubi Arcano Dei</i>, We declared that this appertains undeniably to the pastoral ministry and to Christian life. But since, as We have already indicated, We are addressing Ourselves to pastors who must regain a sorely tried and to a certain extent dispersed flock, today more than ever before We recommend that you make use of those secular people to whom, as living stones of the Holy House of God, St. Peter attributes a profound dignity which makes them in a certain manner participants in a holy and regal priesthood (1 <i>Peter</i> ii.9).<br/> In fact, every Christian conscious of his dignity and his responsibility as a son of the Church and a member of the Mystical Body of Christ - <i>Multi Unum Corpus Sumus in Christo Singuli Autem Alter Alterius Membra</i> (So we being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another) (<i>Romans </i>xii. 5) - cannot do less than recognize that between the members of this body there must exist a reciprocal communication of life and solidarity of interests. Hence the duty of each in the order of life and the increase of the whole organism <i>in aedificationem Corporis Chrisn</i>: hence the efficacious contribution of each member toward the glorification of the Head and of His Mystical Body (<i>Ephesians</i> iv. 12-16).<br/> From these clear and simple principles, what consoling deductions, what luminous directives arise for many souls still uncertain and diffident, but desirous of orientating their ardor! What incitements to contribute to the spread of the Kingdom of Christ and to the salvation of souls!</p> <p align=\"left\">9. Nevertheless, it is evident that the apostolate thus understood does not come from a purely natural impulse to action, but is the fruit of a solid interior formation: it is the necessary expansion of an intense love of Jesus Christ and of souls redeemed by His Precious Blood, which is actuated by studying to imitate His life of prayer, of sacrifice, of inextinguishable zeal. This imitation of Christ will excite multiple forms of apostolate in every field, wherever souls are in danger or the rights of the Divine King compromised; it will extend to all the works of the apostolate, which in any manner enter into the divine mission of the Church, and consequently will penetrate not only the soul of each individual, but also into the sanctuary of the family, the school and even public life.</p> <p align=\"left\">10. But the magnitude of the work must not cause you to preoccupy yourselves more than the number of collaborators than with the quality. Following the example of the Divine Master, who wished to precede the few years of His apostolic work with a long preparation, and limited Himself to forming in the Apostolic College not many but select instruments for the future conquest of the world, so you also, Venerable Brethren, should care first of all for the supernatural formation of your directors and propagandists, without being too much preoccupied or grieved because at the beginning they form but a <i>pusillus grex</i> (<i>Luke</i> xii. 32).</p> <p align=\"left\">11. And since We know that you are already working in this direction, We express to you Our satisfaction that you have already scrupulously selected and carefully formed good collaborators, who with word and example will bring the fervor of the Christian life and the Christian apostolate into the dioceses and the parishes. This, your work, will certainly succeed in being solid and deep, averse to publicity, tumult, noisy forms, working in silence, even without very apparent or immediate fruit; after the manner of the seed, which, in the apparent repose beneath the soil, prepares the new vigorous plant.</p> <p align=\"left\">12. On the other hand, the spiritual formation and the interior life fostered in these your collaborators, will put them on their guard against dangers and possible deviations. Keeping in mind the ultimate aim of Catholic Action, which is the sanctification of souls, according to the Gospel precept: See ye first the Kingdom of God (<i>Luke</i> xii. 31), you will not run the risk of sacrificing principles for immediate and secondary ends, and that supreme end will never be forgotten to which must be subordinated even social and economic works and charitable undertakings.<br/> Our Lord Jesus Christ taught us this with example; because when in the ineffable tenderness of His Divine Heart which makes Him exclaim: I have compassion on the multitude . . . And if I shall send them away fasting to their home, they will faint in the way (<i>Mark </i>viii. 2 to 3), He healed the infirmities of the body and came to the assistance of temporal needs, He had the supreme end of His mission always in view, that is, the glory of His Father and the eternal salvation of souls.</p> <p align=\"left\">13. The so-called social works, in the meantime, are not to escape the activities of Catholic Action, inasmuch as they aim at putting into practice the principles of justice and charity, and inasmuch as they are means of approaching the multitudes; since often souls are not reached except through the relief of corporal miseries and economic needs. And this We, Ourselves, as did Our predecessor of blessed memory, Leo XIII, recommended several times. But it is also true that, if Catholic Action has the duty of preparing men fit to direct such works, and of pointing out the principles which must guide them, with norms and directions drawn from the genuine sources of Our Encyclicals, it must not nevertheless assume the responsibility in that part which is purely technical, financial, economic, which is outside its competency and outside its purpose.</p> <p align=\"left\">14. Facing the frequent accusations made against the Church, that it is indifferent to social problems, or incapable of solving them, do not desist from proclaiming that only the teaching and the work of the Church, assisted as it is by its Divine Founder, can furnish a remedy for the very grave ills which burden humanity. It is for you then (as you have already shown your wish to do) to draw from these fruitful principles the certain norms to solve the grave social questions with which your country is struggling today, which are, for example, the agrarian problem, the reduction of the <i>latifundia</i> (large landed estates), the improvement of the living conditions of the working men and their families.</p> <p align=\"left\">15. Thus, while saving the essence of the primary and fundamental rights, such as the right of ownership, remember that at times the common good imposes restrictions on such rights as a recourse more frequent than in the past to the applications of social justice. As a protection for the dignity of the human being, it may be necessary at times to denounce and to blame boldly unjust and unworthy living conditions; at the same time, however, care must be taken to guard against either making violence legitimate with the pretext of applying a remedy to the ills of the people, or admitting and favoring those rapid and violent changes of temporal conditions of society which may lead to effects that are more harmful than the evil itself which is intended to be corrected.</p> <p align=\"left\">16. This intervention in the social question will bring you likewise to occupy yourselves with the lot of so many poor workingmen who too easily become the prey of de-Christianizing propaganda, with the mirage of economic advantages presented to them as a reward for their apostasy from God and from His Church. If you truly love the laborer (and you must love him because his conditions of life approach nearer to those of the Divine Master), you must assist him materially and religiously. Materially, bringing about in his favor the practice not only of commutative justice but also of social justice, that is, all those provisions which aim at relieving the condition of the proletarian; and then, religiously, giving him again the religious comforts without which he will struggle in a materialism that brutalizes him and degrades him.</p> <p align=\"left\">17. No less grave and no less urgent is another duty: that of the religious and economic assistance of the <i>campesinos </i>(peasants), and in general of that not small portion of your sons forming the population, mostly agricultural, of the Indians. There are millions of souls, they too redeemed by Christ, entrusted by Him to your care and for whom He will some day ask you to render an account; there are millions of individual men often in such sad and miserable living conditions that they have not even that minimum of well-being indispensable to protect their very dignity as men. We conjure you, Venerable Brethren, in the bosom of the charity of Christ to have particular care for these children, to encourage your clergy to devote themselves with ever-increasing zeal to their assistance, and to interest the whole Mexican Catholic Action in this work of moral and material redemption.</p> <p align=\"left\">18. Nor can We fail to mention a duty which in these recent times is ever increasing in importance: the assistance for Mexicans who have emigrated to other countries, who, torn away from their country and their traditions, more easily become prey to the insidious propaganda of the emissaries seeking to induce them to apostatize from their Faith. An arrangement with your zealous confreres of the United States of America will bring about a more diligent and organized care on the part of the local clergy and will assure for the Mexican emigrants those social and economic provisions which are so well developed in the Church in the United States.</p> <p align=\"left\">19. If Catholic Action cannot neglect the most humble and the most needy classes, of the laborers, of the peasants, of the emigrants, it has in other fields no less grave and inescapable duties; among other things it must occupy itself solicitously with the students who some day will have, as professional men and women, a great influence in society and will perhaps hold public offices. To the practice of the Christian religion, to the formation of character and the Christian conscience, which are fundamental elements for all the Faithful, you must associate a special and correct education and intellectual preparation, supported by Christian philosophy - that is, that philosophy which was truthfully called perennial philosophy. Today, in fact, a solid and adequate religious instruction seems still more necessary in view of the tendency, always more generalized, of modern life toward externals, the repugnance toward and difficulty of reflection and recollec tion, and the propensity, even in the spiritual life, to allow sentiment rather than reason to be guide.</p> <p align=\"left\">20. We ardently desire that you carry out among yourselves, at least to the degree possible and adapting the instruction to particular condi tions, to the necessities and possibilities of your country, that which Catholic Action is so well doing in other countries for cultural formation and to assure that religious instruction should hold an intellectual primacy among students and educated Catholics.</p> <p align=\"left\">21. The university students who are actively engaged in Catholic Action give Us great hope for a better future for Mexico, and We do not doubt that they will fulfil Our hopes. It is evident that they are a part, and an important part, of this Catholic Action which is so close to Our heart, whatever be the forms of its organization, since these depend in great part on local conditions and circumstances which vary from region to region. These university students not only afford, as We have said, the most valid hopes for a better tomorrow, but even today can render effective service to the Church and to the country, by the apostolate which they carry on among their companions as well as by supplying the various branches and various organizations of Catholic Action with capable and enlightened directors.</p> <p align=\"left\">22. The special conditions of your country oblige Us to recall the necessary, obligatory, inescapable, care of the children, whose innocence is ensnared, whose education and Christian formation is thus so sorely tried. Two grave precepts are imposed on all Catholic Mexicans: the one negative, that is, to keep the children as far away as possible from the impious and corruptive school; the other positive, to give them complete and accurate religious instruction and the necessary assistance to maintain their spiritual life. Regarding the first point, a grave and delicate one, We recently took occasion to manifest Our thoughts. As regards religious instruction, although We know with what insistence you yourselves have recommended it to your priests and to your Faithful, yet We repeat that, this being one of the most important and capital problems of the Mexican Church today, it is necessary that what is so laudably practiced in some dioceses today should be extended to all the others, in such a manner that the priests and members of Catholic Action apply themselves with all ardor and at cost of any sacrifice to conserve for God and the Church these little ones, for whom the Divine Saviour has shown such predilection.</p> <p align=\"left\">23. The future of these younger generations (We repeat it with all the anguish of Our paternal heart) awakens in Us the most urgent solicitude and the most lively anxiety. We know to how many perils the children and youth are exposed, today more than ever, everywhere, but particularly in Mexico, where an immoral and antireligious press implants in their hearts the seeds of apostasy from Jesus Christ. To remedy such grave evil and defend your youth from these perils, it is necessary that every legal means be taken and every form of organization be put in motion, as for example, the Leagues of Fathers of Families and the morality and vigilance committees for publications and censorship of the cinema.</p> <p align=\"left\">24. Regarding the individual defense of children and youths, We know, from reports which reach Us from all over the world, that activity in the ranks of Catholic Action constitutes the best protection against the strategems of evil, the most efficacious training ground in Christian strength. These youths, enraptured with the beauty of the Christian ideal, sustained by the Divine Help which is assured by prayer and the Sacraments, will dedicate themselves with ardor and joy to the conquest of the souls of their companions, gathering consoling harvests of good.</p> <p align=\"left\">25. In this We have another proof that in view of the grave problems of Mexico, it must not be said that Catholic Action holds a place of secondary importance. If ever this institution, which is the educator of consciences and the former of moral qualities, were set aside in favor of another extrinsic work of whatsoever species, even if it were a case of defending necessary religious and civil liberty, it would be a sad mistake; because the salvation of Mexico, as of all human society, lies above all in the eternal and immutable evangelical doctrine and in the sincere practice of Christian morals.</p> <p align=\"left\">26. For the rest, once this gradation of values and activities is established, it must be admitted that for Christian life to develop itself it must have recourse to external and sensible means; that the Church, being a society of men, cannot exist or develop if it does not enjoy liberty of action, and that its members have the right to find in civil society the possibility of living according to the dictates of their consciences. Consequently, it is quite natural that when the most elementary religious and civil liberties are attacked, Catholic citizens do not resign themselves passively to renouncing those liberties. Notwithstanding, the revindication of these rights and liberties can be, according to the circumstances, more or less opportune, more or less energetic.</p> <p align=\"left\">27. You have more than once recalled to your Faithful that the Church protects peace and order, even at the cost of grave sacrifices, and that it condemns every unjust insurrection or violence against constituted powers. On the other hand, among you it has also been said that, whenever these powers arise against justice and truth even to destroying the very foundations of authority, it is not to be seen how those citizens are to be condemned who united to defend themselves and the nation, by licit and appropriate means, against those who make use of public power to bring it to ruin.</p> <p align=\"left\">28. If the practical solution depends on concrete circumstances, We must, however, on Our part recall to you some general principles, always to be kept in mind, and they are:<br/> 1) That these revindications have reason [the ratio] of means, or of relative end, not of ultimate and absolute end;<br/> 2) That, in reason [ratio] of means, they must be licit actions and not intrinsically evil;<br/> 3) That, if they are to be means proportionate to the end, they must be used only in the measure in which they serve to obtain or render possible, in whole or in part, the end, and in such manner that they do not cause to the community greater damages than those they seek to repair;<br/> 4) That the use of such means and the exercise of civic and political rights in their fulness, embracing also problems of order purely material and technical, or any violent defense, does not enter in any manner in the task of the clergy or of Catholic Action as such, although to both appertains the preparation of Catholics to make just use of their rights, and to defend them with all legitimate means according as the common good requires;<br/> 5) The clergy and Catholic Action, being, by their mission of peace and love, consecrated to uniting all men in <i>vinculo pacis</i> (<i>Ephesians</i> iv. 3), must contribute to the prosperity of the nation, especially encouraging the union of those social initiatives which are not opposed to dogma or to the laws of Christian morals.<br/> Furthermore, this very civil activity of the Mexican Catholics, carried out with such a noble and elevated spirit, will obtain results that are the more efficacious the more the Catholics themselves shall have the supernatural vision of life, that religious and moral education and that burning zeal for the spread of the Kingdom of Our Lord Jesus Christ which Catholic Action intends to give.</p> <p align=\"left\">29. In the presence of a happy coalition of consciences which do not intend to renounce the liberty vindicated for them by Christ (<i>Galatians</i> iv. 31), what power or human force could yoke them to sin? What dangers, what persecutions, what trials could separate souls thus tempered by the charity of Christ? (<i>Romans</i> viii. 35)</p> <p align=\"left\">30. This right formation of the perfect Christian and citizen, in which the supernatural ennobles all the talents and actions and exalts them, contains also, as is natural, the fulfilment of civil and social duties. Facing the adversaries of the Church, St. Augustine proclaimed in praise of his faith: Give me such fathers of families, such children, such masters, such subjects, such husbands, such spouses, such men of government, such citizens, as those which Christian Doctrine forms, and if you cannot give them, confess that this Christian Doctrine, if practiced, is the salvation of the State (<i>Epistle</i> cxxxviii. 2).</p> <p align=\"left\">31. Thus a Catholic will take care not to pass over his right to vote when the good of the Church or of the country requires it. Thus there will be avoided the danger of seeing Catholics, in the exercise of their civil and political activities, organizing in particular groups, at times disputing among themselves or also contrary to the directions of the ecclesiastical authorities. That would be increasing the confusion and scattering the forces, to the complete detriment both of the development of Catholic Action and of the very cause that they wish to defend.</p> <p align=\"left\">32. We have already mentioned activities which, although not conflicting with, are certainly outside the scope of Catholic Action, such as would be those of a political party or those which are purely economic and social. But there exist many other beneficent activities-such as the Leagues of Fathers of Families, for the defense of scholastic liberty and religious instruction, the union of citizens for the defense of the family and the sanctity of matrimony, and of public morality, which can be reorganized about the central nucleus of Catholic Action. In fact, it does not hold itself rigidly to fixed plans, but rather coordinates, as if about a radial center of light and heat, other initiatives and auxiliary institutions; which, enjoying always a just autonomy and a fitting liberty of action necessary for the accomplishment of their specific aims, feel the need of following the directions of its program.</p> <p align=\"left\">33. That holds above all for your nation which is so extensive, where the variety of the needs and of local conditions may demand that, though on the basis of common principles, different methods of organization be used and different but equally just practical solutions be reached for the one same problem.</p> <p align=\"left\">34. It will be for you, Venerable Brethren, placed by the Holy Spirit to rule the Church of God, to give the final practical decision in these cases, to which the Faithful will give their obedience and fidelity according to your instructions. And this is extremely close to Our heart, because the right intention and obedience are always and everywhere the indispensable conditions to draw down the Divine blessings upon the pastoral ministry and upon Catholic Action and to determine that unity of address and that fusion of energies which are an indispensable presupposition for the fruitfulness of the apostolate. With all Our spirit, therefore, We conjure the good Mexican Catholics to hold Obedience and Discipline dear. \"Obey your prelates, and be subject to them. For they watch as being to render an account of your souls.\" And let this obedience be full of joy and a stimulus to greater energies: \"That they may do this with joy, and not with grief\" (<i>Hebrews</i> xiii. 17). He who obeys unwillingly and only through force, venting his interior resentment in bitter criticism of his superiors and companions in work, of all that which is not according to his own way of viewing things, drives away the Divine benedictions, destroys the strength of discipline, and destroys where he ought to construct.</p> <p align=\"left\">35. Together with obedience and discipline, We are pleased to recall those other duties of universal charity which are suggested to us by St. Paul in that same chapter iv. of the Letter to the Ephesians, which We have already quoted and which ought to be the fundamental norm of all those who work in Catholic Action: \"I, therefore, a prisoner in the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy . . . with all humility and mildness, with patience, supporting one another in charity, careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, one body and one Spirit\" (<i>Ephesians</i> iv. 1 to 4).</p> <p align=\"left\">36. To Our dearest Mexican children, who are such a part of the cares and of the affectionate solicitudes of Our Pontificate, We renew the appeal to unity, to charity, to peace, in the apostolic labor of Catholic Action, which must give back Christ to Mexico and restore there peace and also temporal prosperity.</p> <p align=\"left\">37. We deposit Our wishes and Our prayers at the feet of your heavenly Patroness, invoked under the title of Our Lady of Guadalupe, who, in her sanctuary, still excites the love and the veneration of every Mexican.</p> <p align=\"left\">38. Of her, who under this title is venerated and blessed also in this city where We, Ourselves, have erected a parish dedicated in her honor, We earnestly ask that she hear Our prayers and yours for the prosperous future of Mexico, for the Peace of Christ in the Reign of Christ. With these wishes and with these sentiments, We impart with all Our heart to you, to your priests, to the Mexican Catholic Action, to all the beloved children of Mexico, to the whole noble Mexican nation, a very special Apostolic Benediction.</p> <p align=\"left\">39.

Questo Ci conforta nelle nostre amarezze e Ci dà affidamento a bene sperare per l’avvenire della Chiesa messicana; la quale, rinvigorita da tanto eroismo e sostenuta dalle preghiere e dalle sofferenze di tante anime elette, non può perire; dovrà anzi rifiorire più vegeta e più rigogliosa. </p><p align=\"left\"> Ora, appunto per ravvivare la vostra fiducia nell’aiuto divino e per incoraggiarvi a continuare nella pratica di una vita cristiana e fervorosa, Noi vi indirizziamo questa lettera, e ne prendiamo occasione per ricordarvi come, nelle presenti circostanze e difficoltà, i mezzi più efficaci per una restaurazione cristiana sono anche tra voi anzitutto la santità dei sacerdoti e in secondo luogo l’accurata formazione dei laici, tale da poterli associare nella valida cooperazione all’apostolato gerarchico, tanto più necessaria nel Messico e per la vastità del territorio e per le altre condizioni a tutti note. </p><p align=\"left\"> Il Nostro pensiero pertanto corre in primo luogo a quelli che devono essere la luce che illumina, il sale che conserva, il buon fermento che penetra tutta la massa dei fedeli, cioè ai vostri sacerdoti.</p><p align=\"left\"> Veramente Noi sappiamo già con quanta tenacia ed a costo di quali sacrifici voi curate, Venerabili Fratelli, la cernita e l’incremento delle vocazioni sacerdotali, in mezzo a difficoltà di ogni sorta, ben persuasi, come siete, di provvedere così ad un problema vitale, anzi al più vitale problema per l’avvenire di codesta Chiesa. Così, di fronte alla impossibilità quasi assoluta di avere oggi nella vostra patria Seminari ben ordinati e tranquilli, voi avete trovato in quest’Alma Città, per i vostri chierici, un rifugio largo e affettuoso nel Collegio Pio Latino Americano, il quale ha formato già e va formando alla scienza e alla virtù tanti benemeriti sacerdoti e che per la sua opera preziosa è a Noi particolarmente caro. Ma non essendo in moltissimi casi possibile inviare i vostri alunni fino a Roma, vi siete opportunamente adoperati per trovare un asilo nella ospitalità di una grande nazione vicina.</p><p align=\"left\"> Nel congratularCi con voi per la lodevole impresa, che sta diventando una consolante realtà, esprimiamo di nuovo la Nostra riconoscenza a tutti coloro che sono stati larghi con voi di ospitalità e di aiuto. </p><p align=\"left\"> E con paterna insistenza ricordiamo ancora in quest’occasione il Nostro preciso volere che sia illustrata e spiegata convenientemente, non solo ai chierici ma a tutti i sacerdoti, la Nostra Enciclica <i><a href=\"/content/pius-xi/it/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19351220_ad-catholici-sacerdotii.html\">Ad Catholici Sacerdotii</a></i>, la quale espone il Nostro pensiero su questo, che è il più grave e il più importante fra i gravi ed importanti argomenti da Noi trattati. </p><p align=\"left\"> Formati così i sacerdoti messicani, secondo il cuore di Cristo, essi sentiranno che nelle attuali condizioni della loro Patria — già ricordate nella Lettera Apostolica <i>Paterna sane sollicitud</i>o del 2 febbraio 1926 e che sono così simili a quelle dei primi tempi della Chiesa, quando gli Apostoli facevano appello alla collaborazione dei laici — ben ardua cosa sarebbe guadagnare a Dio tante anime senza l’ausilio provvidenziale che prestano i laici mediante l’Azione Cattolica. Tanto più che in essa la Grazia prepara non di rado anime generose, pronte alla più preziosa attività, quando trovino in un clero dotto e santo una conveniente comprensione e guida. </p><p align=\"left\"> Pertanto ai sacerdoti messicani, che hanno dedicato tutta la loro vita a servizio di Gesù Cristo, della sua Chiesa e delle anime, rivolgiamo il primo e più caldo appello, affinché vogliano generosamente assecondare le Nostre e vostre sollecitudini per il progresso dell’Azione Cattolica, dedicando ad essa le migliori loro forze e le diligenze più opportune. </p><p align=\"left\"> I metodi di una efficace collaborazione dei laici all’azione vostra ed all’apostolato non verranno mai a scarseggiare, se i sacerdoti si daranno premura di coltivare il popolo cristiano con una saggia direzione spirituale e con una accurata istruzione religiosa, non diluita in vani discorsi, ma nutrita di sana dottrina attinta alle Sacre Scritture e piena di forza e di pietà. </p><p align=\"left\"> È vero che non tutti comprendono appieno la necessità di questo santo apostolato del laicato cattolico, sebbene fin dalla prima Nostra Enciclica <i> <a href=\"/content/pius-xi/it/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19221223_ubi-arcano-dei-consilio.html\">Ubi arcano Dei</a></i> Noi abbiamo dichiarato che essa appartiene innegabilmente al ministero pastorale ed alla vita cristiana. </p><p align=\"left\"> Ma poiché, come già accennammo, Ci dirigiamo a Pastori che debbono riconquistare un gregge così provato e talvolta disperso, più che mai vi raccomandiamo di servirvi di quei laici ai quali, come a pietra viva della santa Casa di Dio, San Pietro attribuiva una arcana dignità, che li fa in qualche modo partecipi di un sacerdozio santo e regale [<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">1</a>]. </p><p align=\"left\"> Ogni cristiano, infatti, che comprende la sua dignità e sente la sua responsabilità di figlio della Chiesa e di membro del Corpo mistico di Gesù Cristo — « <i>pur essendo molti, siamo un solo corpo in Cristo e, ciascuno per la sua parte, siamo membra gli uni degli altri</i> »[<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">2</a>] — non può non riconoscere che fra tutte le membra di questo Corpo deve esistere una comunicazione reciproca di vita e solidarietà di interessi. </p><p align=\"left\"> Di qui il dovere di ciascuno in ordine alla vita ed all’incremento di tutto l’organismo, « <i>al fine di edificare il Corpo di Cristo</i> »; di qui ancora l’efficace contributo di ciascun membro alla glorificazione del Capo e del suo Corpo mistico [<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\">3</a>]. </p><p align=\"left\"> Da questi chiari e semplici princìpi, quali consolanti deduzioni, quali luminose direttive non scaturiscono per molte anime, ancora incerte e diffidenti, ma desiderose di orientare il loro ardore! quali incitamenti a contribuire alla diffusione del Regno di Cristo e alla salvezza delle anime! </p><p align=\"left\"> È evidente per altro che l’apostolato così compreso non proviene da un impulso puramente naturale all’azione, ma è frutto di una solida formazione interiore: è la necessaria espansione di un amore intenso a Gesù Cristo e alle anime, redente dal suo Sangue prezioso, che si attua nello studio di imitarne la vita di preghiere, di sacrificio, di zelo inestinguibile. </p><p align=\"left\"> Questa imitazione di Cristo susciterà molteplici forme di apostolato in tutti i campi, dovunque le anime sono in pericolo o sono compromessi i diritti del Re divino. Si estenderà pertanto questa Azione Cattolica a tutte le opere di apostolato che in qualsiasi modo rientrino nella divina missione della Chiesa, e quindi penetrerà, come nell’animo degli individui, così nel santuario della famiglia, nella scuola e nella stessa vita pubblica. </p><p align=\"left\"> Né la vastità del compito dovrà farvi ricercare maggiormente il numero che non la qualità dei collaboratori. Secondo l’esempio del Divin Maestro, che volle premettere a pochi suoi anni di lavoro apostolico una lunga preparazione, e si limitò a formare nel Collegio Apostolico non molti ma scelti strumenti per la successiva conquista del mondo, così anche voi, Venerabili Fratelli, curerete in primo luogo la formazione soprannaturale dei vostri dirigenti e propagandisti, senza troppo impensierirvi né affliggervi se saranno da principio un « <i>piccolo gregge</i> » [<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">4</a>]. </p><p align=\"left\"> E poiché sappiamo che voi già state lavorando in questo senso, vi esprimiamo il Nostro compiacimento per avere già scrupolosamente scelto e premurosamente formato buoni collaboratori, che porteranno con la parola e con l’esempio il fervore della vita e dell’apostolato cristiano nelle diocesi e nelle parrocchie. </p><p align=\"left\"> Codesto vostro lavoro riuscirà certo solido e profondo, alieno dalla pubblicità, dal rumore, da forme clamorose, operante nel silenzio, anche senza frutti molto appariscenti od immediati: a guisa del seme, che nell’apparente riposo sotterra prepara la nuova pianta rigogliosa. </p><p align=\"left\"> D’altra parte la formazione spirituale e la vita interiore, che fomentate in questi vostri collaboratori, li metteranno in guardia dai pericoli e dalle possibili deviazioni. Tenendo presente il fine ultimo dell’Azione Cattolica, che è la santificazione delle anime, secondo il precetto evangelico: «<i>Cercate anzitutto il regno di Dio</i> » [<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">5</a>], non si correrà il rischio di sacrificare i princìpi a fini immediati e secondari e non si dimenticherà mai che a quel fine supremo si debbono subordinare anche le opere sociali ed economiche e le iniziative caritatevoli. </p><p align=\"left\"> Il Signor Nostro Gesù Cristo ce lo insegnò con l’esempio: perché anche quando, nella ineffabile tenerezza del suo Cuore divino che gli faceva esclamare: « <i>Sento compassione di questa folla … Se li rimando digiuni alle proprie case, verranno meno per via</i> »[<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\">6</a>], guariva le infermità del corpo e sovveniva ai bisogni temporali, aveva sempre di mira il fine supremo della sua missione, cioè la gloria del Padre suo, e la salute eterna delle anime. </p><p align=\"left\"> Non sfuggono pertanto all’attività dell’Azione Cattolica le cosiddette opere sociali, in quanto mirano ad attuare i princìpi della giustizia e della carità e in quanto sono mezzi per avvicinare le moltitudini; giacché spesso non si giunge alle anime se non mediante il sollievo delle miserie corporali e delle necessità economiche. Il che Noi stessi, come già il Nostro Predecessore di s. m. <a href=\"/content/leo-xiii/it.html\">Leone XIII</a>, raccomandammo più volte. Ma è pur vero che, se l’Azione Cattolica ha il dovere di preparare uomini adatti per dirigere tali opere e di segnarne i princìpi che devono guidare con le norme e le direttive attinte alle genuine fonti delle Encicliche, non deve tuttavia assumerne la responsabilità in quella parte puramente tecnica, finanziaria, economica, che sta fuori dalle sue competenze e dalle sue finalità. </p><p align=\"left\"> Di fronte alle frequenti accuse fatte alla Chiesa di essere indifferente ai problemi sociali, o inetta a risolverli, non si cessi dal proclamare che soltanto la dottrina e l’opera della Chiesa, assistita com’è dal divino suo Fondatore, può portare rimedio ai gravissimi mali che travagliano l’umanità. </p><p align=\"left\"> A voi dunque (come già avete dimostrato di volere fare) spetta attingere a questi princìpi fecondi le norme sicure, per risolvere le gravi questioni sociali nelle quali oggi si dibatte la vostra Patria, quali sono ad esempio il problema agrario, la riduzione dei latifondi, il miglioramento delle condizioni di vita dei lavoratori e delle loro famiglie. </p><p align=\"left\"> Così, pur mettendo sempre in salvo l’essenza dei diritti primari e fondamentali, quali, ad esempio, il diritto di proprietà, ricorderete come talvolta il bene comune imponga restrizioni a tali diritti e un ricorso, più frequente che in passato, alle applicazioni della giustizia sociale. </p><p align=\"left\"> A tutela della dignità della persona umana può occorrere talvolta denunciare e biasimare arditamente condizioni di vita ingiuste e indegne; nello stesso tempo però bisognerà guardarsi, sia dal legittimare la violenza col pretesto di portare rimedio ai mali del popolo, sia dall’ammettere e favorire quelle rapide e violente mutazioni di condizioni secolari della società, che possono portare a effetti più funesti del male stesso al quale si voleva porre riparo. </p><p align=\"left\"> Questo intervento nella questione sociale vi porterà altresì ad occuparvi con zelo particolare della sorte di tanti poveri operai, che troppo facilmente divengono preda di una propaganda scristianizzatrice, col miraggio di vantaggi economici presentati alle loro menti quasi mercede della loro apostasia da Dio e dalla sua Chiesa. </p><p align=\"left\"> Se amate veramente l’operaio (e dovete amarlo perché le sue condizioni di vita maggiormente si avvicinano a quelle del divino Maestro) dovete assisterlo materialmente e religiosamente. Materialmente, procurando che sia a suo favore praticata non solo la giustizia commutativa ma anche la giustizia sociale, cioè tutte quelle provvidenze che mirano a sollevarne la condizione di proletario; religiosamente poi, ridandogli i conforti religiosi, senza i quali egli si dibatterà in un materialismo che lo abbrutisce e lo degrada. </p><p align=\"left\"> Non meno grave né meno urgente è un altro dovere; quello della assistenza religiosa ed economica dei « campesinos » ed in genere di quella parte non piccola di vostri figli che formano la popolazione, per lo più agricola, degli Indii. Sono milioni di anime, pur esse redente da Cristo, da Lui affidate alle vostre cure e di cui vi chiederà conto un giorno: sono milioni di individui spesso in così tristi e miserevoli condizioni di vita, da non avere nemmeno quel minimo di benessere indispensabile per tutelare la stessa dignità umana. Vi scongiuriamo, Venerabili Fratelli, nelle viscere della carità di Cristo, ad aver cura particolare di cotesti figli, ad incoraggiare il vostro clero a dedicarsi con sempre crescente zelo alla loro assistenza, e ad interessare tutta l’Azione Cattolica Messicana a quest’opera di redenzione morale e materiale. </p><p align=\"left\"> Né possiamo qui omettere un cenno a un dovere che in questi ultimi anni va sempre crescendo d’importanza: l’assistenza ai Messicani emigrati all’estero, i quali, sradicati dalla loro terra e dalle loro tradizioni, più facilmente divengono preda della insidiosa propaganda di emissari, che cercano di indurli ad apostatare dalla loro Fede. Un accordo con i vostri zelanti confratelli degli Stati Uniti d’America procurerà una cura più diligente ed organizzata da parte del clero locale, ed assicurerà agli emigrati messicani quelle provvidenze economiche e sociali che sono così sviluppate nella Chiesa Nord americana. </p><p align=\"left\"> Se l’Azione Cattolica non può trascurare le classi più umili e più bisognose degli operai, dei contadini, degli emigrati, ha in altri campi non meno gravi ed imprescindibili doveri. Fra l’altro essa deve con sollecitudine tutta particolare occuparsi degli studenti, che un giorno avranno, come professionisti, una grande influenza nella società e forse anche copriranno cariche pubbliche. Alla pratica della religione cristiana, alla formazione dell’indole e della coscienza cattolica, che sono elementi fondamentali per tutti i fedeli, dovete associare una speciale ed accurata educazione e preparazione intellettuale, appoggiata alla filosofia cristiana, quella cioè che con tanta verità fu detta filosofia perenne. Oggi, infatti, una solida ed adeguata istruzione religiosa sembra ancora più necessaria che in altri tempi, data la contraria tendenza sempre più generale della vita moderna alle esteriorità, la riluttanza e difficoltà alla riflessione e al raccoglimento, anzi la propensione, anche nella vita religiosa, a lasciarsi guidare più dal sentimento che dalla ragione. </p><p align=\"left\"> Quello che lodevolmente fa l’Azione Cattolica in altri paesi per la formazione culturale e per ottenere che l’istruzione religiosa abbia il primato intellettuale fra gli studenti e laureati cattolici, desideriamo ardentemente che si faccia, nella misura del possibile, anche tra di voi, adattando l’istruzione alle particolari condizioni, necessità e possibilità della vostra Patria. </p><p align=\"left\"> Ci dànno molta fiducia per un migliore avvenire del Messico gli universitari che militano nell’Azione Cattolica, e non dubitiamo che essi corrisponderanno alle Nostre speranze. È evidente che essi sono parte, e parte importante, di questa Azione Cattolica che Ci sta così a cuore, quali siano le sue forme organizzative, che dipendono in gran parte da condizioni e circostanze locali, varianti da paese a paese. Questi universitari, anzi, non solo ci assicurano, come dicemmo, le più valide speranze di un domani migliore, ma oggi stesso possono rendere effettivi servizi alla Chiesa e alla Patria, sia con l’apostolato che compiono tra i loro compagni, sia dando ai vari rami e alle varie organizzazioni dell’Azione Cattolica capaci e illuminati dirigenti. </p><p align=\"left\"> Le speciali condizioni della vostra Patria ci obbligano a richiamarvi la necessaria, doverosa, imprescindibile cura dei fanciulli, la cui innocenza è insidiata, la cui educazione e formazione cristiana sono messe a così dura prova. </p><p align=\"left\"> A tutti i cattolici messicani si impongono due gravi precetti: l’uno negativo, che è di tenere quanto è possibile lontani i fanciulli dalla scuola empia e corruttrice; l’altro positivo, che è di procurare ad essi una conveniente, accurata assistenza ed istruzione religiosa. Sul primo punto, così grave e delicato, abbiamo già avuto, anche recentemente, occasione di farvi conoscere il Nostro pensiero. Per quanto poi riguarda l’istruzione religiosa, sebbene conosciamo con quanta insistenza voi stessi l’abbiate raccomandata ai vostri sacerdoti e ai vostri fedeli, pur vi ripetiamo che, essendo questo uno fra i più importanti e capitali problemi di oggi per la Chiesa messicana, è necessario che quanto si fa già lodevolmente in alcune diocesi si estenda a tutte le altre, in modo che i sacerdoti e i militi dell’Azione Cattolica si applichino con ogni ardore e senza badare ad alcun sacrifizio a conservare a Dio e alla Chiesa questi piccoli, per i quali il divino Salvatore ha mostrato tanta predilezione. </p><p align=\"left\"> L’avvenire di queste giovani generazioni — ve lo ripetiamo con tutta l’angoscia del Nostro cuore paterno — desta in Noi le più vive sollecitudini e le più gravi ansietà. Sappiamo a quali pericoli sono esposte oggi più che mai la fanciullezza e la gioventù, dappertutto, ma in particolar modo nel Messico, dove una stampa immorale e antireligiosa pone nei loro cuori i germi della loro apostasia da Gesù Cristo. Per rimediare a tanta iattura e premunire i vostri giovani da siffatti pericoli, occorre che tutti gli espedienti legali e tutte le forme organizzative siano posti in atto, come, per esempio, le Leghe di Padri di famiglia, i Comitati di moralità e di vigilanza sulle pubblicazioni e di censura dei cinematografi. </p><p align=\"left\"> Per quello che riguarda la difesa individuale dei singoli, Noi ben sappiamo, per testimonianza che Ci perviene da tutto il mondo, che il militare nelle file dell’Azione Cattolica costituisce il presidio migliore contro le insidie del male, la più bella scuola di virtù e di purezza, la più efficace palestra di fortezza cristiana. Proprio questi giovani, rapiti dalla bellezza dell’ideale cristiano, sostenuti dall’aiuto divino che si assicurano con la preghiera e con i sacramenti, si dedicheranno con ardore e con gioia alla conquista delle anime dei loro compagni, raccogliendo consolante messe di bene. </p><p align=\"left\"> In ciò abbiamo un’altra prova che, di fronte ai bisogni così grandi del Messico, l’Azione Cattolica non si può dire opera di secondaria importanza. Qualora dunque essa, che è educatrice delle coscienze e formatrice delle doti morali, venisse comunque posposta ad altra opera estrinseca di qualsiasi specie, anche se si trattasse di sorgere a difesa delle necessarie libertà religiose e civili, si commetterebbe un ben doloroso abbaglio; perché la salute del Messico, come di ogni altra società umana, è posta anzitutto nella eterna, immutabile dottrina evangelica e nella pratica sincera della morale cristiana. </p><p align=\"left\"> Stabilita questa graduazione di valori e di attività, deve peraltro ammettersi che la vita cristiana, per svolgersi, ha bisogno pure di ricorrere a mezzi esterni e sensibili; che la Chiesa, essendo una società di uomini, richiede, rispetto alla naturale esigenza della vita e del suo necessario incremento, una legittima libertà d’azione, e che i suoi fedeli hanno diritto di trovare nella società civile possibilità di vivere in conformità ai dettami della loro coscienza. </p><p align=\"left\"> È quindi naturale che, quando le più elementari libertà religiose e civili vengono impugnate, i cittadini cattolici non si rassegnino senz’altro a rinunziarvi. Tuttavia la rivendicazione anche di questi diritti e di queste libertà potrà essere più o meno opportuna, più o meno energica, a seconda delle circostanze. </p><p align=\"left\"> Voi avete più di una volta ricordato ai vostri fedeli che la Chiesa è fautrice di ordine e di pace, anche a costo di gravi sacrifici, e che condanna ogni ingiusta insurrezione e violenza contro i poteri costituiti. D’altra parte fra di voi si è pure detto che, qualora questi poteri insorgessero contro la giustizia e la verità al punto di distruggere le fondamenta stesse dell’autorità, non si vedrebbe come dover condannare quei cittadini che si unissero per difendere con mezzi leciti ed idonei se stessi e la Nazione, contro chi si vale del potere per trarne a rovina la cosa pubblica. </p><p align=\"left\"> Se la soluzione pratica dipende dalle circostanze concrete, dobbiamo tuttavia da parte Nostra ricordarvi alcuni princìpi generali, da tener sempre presenti, e cioè: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p align=\"left\">1) che queste rivendicazioni hanno ragione di mezzo, o di fine relativo, non di fine ultimo ed assoluto; </p>\n<p align=\"left\">2) che, in ragione di mezzo, devono essere azioni lecite e non intrinsecamente cattive; </p>\n<p align=\"left\">3) che, se vogliono essere mezzi proporzionati al fine, devono usarsi solo nella misura in cui servono ad ottenere o rendere possibile, in tutto o in parte, il fine, ed in modo da non recare alla comunità danni maggiori di quelli che si vorrebbero riparare; </p>\n<p align=\"left\">4) che l’uso di tali mezzi e l’esercizio dei diritti civici e politici nella loro pienezza, abbracciando anche problemi di ordine puramente materiale e tecnico, o di difesa violenta, non entrano in alcun modo nei compiti del clero e dell’Azione Cattolica come tali, benché ad essi appartenga preparare i cattolici a far retto uso dei loro diritti ed a propugnarli per tutte le vie legittime, secondo l’esigenza del bene comune; </p>\n<p align=\"left\">5) Il clero e l’Azione Cattolica — essendo per la loro missione di pace e di amore consacrati ad unire tutti gli uomini « nel vincolo della pace »[<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\">7</a>] — devono contribuire alla prosperità della Nazione, specialmente fomentando l’unione dei cittadini e delle classi e collaborando a tutte le iniziative sociali, che non siano in contrasto con il dogma o la legge morale cristiana. </p>\n</blockquote> <p align=\"left\"> Del resto, questa stessa attività civile dei cattolici messicani, svolta con uno spirito così nobile ed elevato, otterrà risultati tanto più efficaci quanto più i cattolici stessi avranno quella visione soprannaturale della vita, quella educazione religiosa e morale e quello zelo ardente per la dilatazione del Regno di Cristo che l’Azione Cattolica si propone di dare. </p><p align=\"left\"> Di fronte a una felice coalizione di coscienze che non intendono rinunziare alla libertà rivendicata loro da Cristo [<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\" title=\"\">8</a>], quale potere o forza umana potrebbe aggiogarle al peccato? Quali pericoli, quali persecuzioni, quali prove potrebbero separare anime così temprate dalla carità di Cristo?[<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\" title=\"\">9</a>]. </p><p align=\"left\"> Questa retta formazione del perfetto cristiano e cittadino, in cui il soprannaturale nobilita tutte le doti e le azioni e le esalta, contiene anche, come è naturale, il compimento dei doveri civili e sociali. Di fronte agli avversari della Chiesa, Sant’Agostino proclamava a lode dei suoi fedeli: «<i>Datemi tali padri di famiglia, tali figli, tali padroni, tali sudditi, tali mariti, tali spose, tali uomini di governo, tali cittadini, come quelli che forma la dottrina cristiana, e se non potete darli, confessate che questa dottrina cristiana, se si pratica, è la salvezza dello Stato</i> »[<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\" title=\"\">10</a>]. </p><p align=\"left\"> Così, un cattolico si guarderà, ad esempio, di trascurare il suo diritto di voto quando viene a repentaglio il bene della Chiesa o della Patria. Né potrà darsi il pericolo di vedere cattolici che per l’esercizio delle attività civiche e politiche si organizzano in gruppi particolari, talvolta contrastanti tra di loro od anche contrari alle direttive dell’autorità ecclesiastica. Ciò sarebbe un accrescere la confusione e un disperdere le forze, a tutto detrimento sia dello sviluppo dell’Azione Cattolica sia della causa stessa che si vorrebbe difendere. </p><p align=\"left\"> Già abbiamo accennato ad attività che, sebbene non contrastanti, sono certo al di fuori dell’Azione Cattolica, come sarebbero quelle di partito politico o quelle prettamente economico-sociali. Ma esistono molte altre benefiche attività — come le Leghe di Padri di Famiglia, per la difesa delle libertà scolastiche e dell’insegnamento religioso, l’Unione di cittadini per la difesa della famiglia e della santità del matrimonio, e della pubblica moralità — che si possono riordinare attorno al nucleo centrale della Azione Cattolica. Essa infatti non si irrigidisce in schemi fissi; coordina anzi, come attorno ad un centro irradiatore di luce e di calore, altre iniziative ed istituzioni ausiliarie che pur godendo di una giusta autonomia e di una opportuna libertà di azione, necessarie per il raggiungimento dei loro fini specifìci, sentono però il bisogno di seguirne le direttive programmatiche. </p><p align=\"left\"> Ciò vale soprattutto per la vostra così estesa Nazione ove la varietà dei bisogni e delle condizioni locali può richiedere che, pur sulla base di princìpi comuni, si usino diversi metodi di organizzazione e si abbiano anche diverse soluzioni pratiche, ma egualmente giuste, di uno stesso problema.</p><p align=\"left\"> Spetterà a voi, Venerabili Fratelli, collocati dallo Spirito Santo a reggere la Chiesa di Dio, dare l’ultima decisione pratica in questi casi, alla quale i fedeli presteranno docilità e fedeltà secondo le vostre direttive. Il che Ci sta sommamente a cuore, perché la retta intenzione e l’obbedienza, sempre e dappertutto, sono le condizioni indispensabili per attirare le benedizioni divine sul ministero pastorale e sull’Azione Cattolica e a determinare quell’unità d’indirizzo e quella fusione di energie che sono un presupposto indispensabile alla fecondità dell’apostolato. Scongiuriamo pertanto con tutto l’animo Nostro i buoni cattolici Messicani ad aver cara l’obbedienza e la disciplina. «<i>Obbedite ai vostri capi e state loro sottomessi. Essi vegliano su di voi, come chi ha da renderne conto</i> ». E sia l’obbedienza piena di gioia e stimolatrice delle migliori energie, « <i>affinché facciano questo con gioia e non gemendo</i> »[<a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\" title=\"\">11</a>]. Chi obbedisce solo a malincuore e come per forza, sfogando l’interno risentimento in amare critiche contro i superiori ed i compagni di lavoro, contro tutto ciò che non è secondo il proprio modo di vedere, allontana le benedizioni divine, infrange il nerbo della disciplina e distrugge là dove si dovrebbe costruire. </p><p align=\"left\"> Insieme con l’obbedienza e la disciplina Ci piace ricordare quegli altri doveri di carità universale che Ci vengono suggeriti da San Paolo in quello stesso cap. IV della Lettera agli Efesini, che abbiamo già citato e che dovrebbe essere la norma fondamentale di tutti quelli che lavorano nella Azione Cattolica: «<i>Vi esorto dunque, io, il prigioniero nel Signore, a comportarvi in maniera degna… con ogni umiltà, mansuetudine e pazienza, sopportandovi a vicenda con amore, cercando di conservare l’unità dello spirito per mezzo del vincolo della pace. Un solo corpo, un solo spirito</i> »[<a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\" title=\"\">12</a>]. </p><p align=\"left\"> Ai Nostri carissimi figli messicani, che sono tanta parte delle cure e delle sollecitudini affettuose del Nostro Pontificato, rinnoviamo l’appello alla unità, alla carità, alla pace, nel lavoro apostolico dell’Azione Cattolica, che dovrà ridonare Cristo al Messico e restituirvi la pace e la prosperità anche temporale. </p><p align=\"left\"> I Nostri voti e le Nostre preghiere deponiamo ai piedi della vostra celeste Patrona invocata sotto il titolo di Nostra Signora di Guadalupe, che nel suo Santuario suscita tuttora l’amore e la venerazione di ogni Messicano. A Lei, che sotto questo titolo è venerata e benedetta anche in quest’Alma Città, dove anzi Noi stessi erigemmo una Parrocchia dedicata in suo onore, chiediamo ardentemente che esaudisca i Nostri e vostri voti, per il prospero avvenire del Messico, della pace di Cristo nel Regno di Cristo. Con questi voti e con questi sentimenti impartiamo di tutto cuore a voi, ai vostri sacerdoti, all’Azione Cattolica Messicana, a tutti i diletti figli del Messico, a tutta la nobile Nazione messicana una specialissima Apostolica Benedizione. </p><p align=\"left\"> Sia questa Nostra Lettera un pegno di risurrezione spirituale pel vostro paese: abbiamo voluto datarla per la Pasqua di Risurrezione, quale paterno auspicio che, come siete stati così vivamente partecipi dei patimenti di Cristo, così sarete del pari partecipi della sua risurrezione. </p><p align=\"left\"> <i>Dato a Roma, presso San Pietro, nella festa della Pasqua di Risurrezione, il 28 marzo 1937, anno XVI del Nostro Pontificato</i>. </p><p align=\"center\">  </p><p align=\"center\"> <b>PIUS PP.

Hoc quidem moerentem animum Nostrum solatur, hoc magnam Nobis affert spem de futuro bono Mexicanae Ecclesiae, quae, heroicis virtutibus roborata, et precibus doloribusque tot electorum animorum innixa, numquam erit peritura, immo vero validior ac florentior, iuvante Deo, revirescet. </p> <p>Itaque, ut vestram divini praesidii fiduciam adaugeamus, novosque vobis spiritus ad rationem christianae vitae alacrius prosequendam addamus, hanc vobis Epistolam mittendam censuimus, qua vos iterum admonemus, in praesentibus rerum adiunctis atque difficultatibus, istic quoque auxilia ad christianos mores redintegrandos omnino necessaria imprimis esse sacerdotum sanctitatem ac deinde talem laicorum institutionem, quae eos cum Ecclesiae Hierarchia consociet tamquam adiutores in apostolatu obeundo. Haec autem laicorum cum clero collaboratio in Mexico maxime expostulatur, tum ob regionis amplitudinem, tum propter peculiaria rerum adiuncta omnibus nota atque perspicua. </p> <p>Nostra igitur cogitatio primo ad eos convertitur, qui esse debent lux quae illuminet, sal qui servet, bonum fermentum, quod totam permeet massam fidelium: ad vestros nempe sacerdotes. </p> <p>Haud profecto ignoramus, quot curis laboribusque vos, Venerabiles Fratres, in ecclesiasticas vocationes discernendas fovendasque, inter omne genus difficultates, incumbatis, id prorsus rati, de re ipsa agi, quae ad Ecclesiae istius conservationem atque incrementum apprime spectet. Quum enim in praesenti sacra Seminaria nequeant istic tranquille et ordinate vivere, nedum florere, vos in hac alma Urbe vestris clericis invenistis liberale ac perhumanum hospitium in Collegio Pio Latino Americano, quod tot sacerdotes bene de Ecclesia merentes ad virtutem doctrinamque finxit ac fingit, ita ut Nobis, ob frugiferam ipsius operam, sit admodum carum. Illis vero haud paucis clericis, qui, usque Romam commigrare nequeant, vos itidem in praeclara proxima natione hospitale refugium apparare studuistis. </p> <p>De eiusmodi incepto, quod nunc in rem feliciter deducitur, vobis, Venerabiles Fratres, libenter gratulamur, cunctisque iis, qui generosam hospitalitatem vel alia adiumenta praebuere, benevolum gratumque animum Nostrum rursus profitemur. </p> <p>Paterna autem instantia, hanc nacti occasionem, iterum iterumque vos adhortamur, ut non modo adolescentibus clericis, sed omnibus quoque sacerdotibus, congruenter explicentur atque illustrentur Litterae Nostrae Encyclicae <i><a href=\"/content/pius-xi/la/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19351220_ad-catholici-sacerdotii.html\">Ad catholici sacerdotii</a></i>, quae mentem Nostram exhibent de re inter ceteras graves, a Nobis declaratas, longe gravissima. </p> <p>Instituti ita secundum Cor Christi, sacerdotes Mexicani intelligent, in hisce patriae suae condicionibus, — quas quidem iam memoravimus per Epistolam Apostolicam <i> <a href=\"/content/pius-xi/la/apost_letters/documents/hf_p-xi_apl_19260202_paterna-sane-sollicitudo.html\">Paterna sane sollicitudo</a></i>, die II mensis Februarii, anno MDCCCCXXVI datam, quaeque in memoriam revocant ipsa Ecclesiae primordia, quum Apostoli auxiliatricem laicorum operam manifeste exquirebant, — perarduum esse tot animas Deo comparare, sine idoneo laicorum per Actionem Catholicam auxilio; eo vel magis, quod inter illos haud raro favente Dei gratia excitantur generosi, qui, si sancti eruditique Dei ministri animos ipsorum intime perspiciant prudenterque regant, prompti sunt ac parati ad actuosam frugiferamque operam clero praestandam. </p> <p>Sacerdotibus ergo Mexicanis, qui Iesu Christo eiusque Ecclesiae in bonum animarum totam vitam mancipavere, primam fervidamque referimus hortationem, ut Nostris vestrisque sollicitudinibus libenter obsecundantes, in Catholicae Actionis progressionem omnes curas viresque impendant. </p> <p>Neque enim viae ac rationes, quibus laici apostolicae vestrae actioni studium afferant, umquam deficient, si sacerdotes christianum populum excolere studuerint, sapienti quidem moderamine ac perdiligenti religionis institutione, quae sit non vaniloquiis redundans, sed e Sacris Litteris exhausta, solidaque flagrans pietate. </p> <p>Verum quidem est, necessitatem huius laicorum catholicorum apostolatus non omnes plane perspectam habere, quamquam usque a primis Litteris Encyclicis <i> <a href=\"/content/pius-xi/la/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19221223_ubi-arcano-dei-consilio.html\">Ubi arcano Dei</a></i> expresse ediximus, Actionem Catholicam ad pastorale ministerium vitamque christianam omnino pertinere. At, quum alloquamur, uti iam innuimus, sacros Pastores, qui gregem ita probatum atque interdum dispersum recuperare debeant, vobis instanter suademus, ut laicorum opera utamini, quibus, tamquam Domus Dei lapidibus vivis, ipse beatissimus Petrus arcanam quandam agnovit dignitatem, per quam sanctum et regale sacerdotium quodammodo participant (1). </p> <p>Quilibet enim christianus, qui suam dignitatem intelligat suamque condicionem perpendat filii Ecclesiae membrique Corporis mystici Iesu Christi, « multi unum corpus sumus in Christo, singuli autem alter alterius membra » (2), nullo modo ignorare potest, inter huius Corporis membra reciprocam vitae communicationem mutuamque rationum participationem adesse oportere. Hac de causa, suam quisque debet operam collocare ad vitam profectumque totius compaginis fovenda, « in aedificationem Corporis Christi », inque eiusdem Capitis glorificationem (3). </p> <p>Ex hisce claris simplicibusque principiis, quam luculentae normae, quam fortia incitamenta erui possunt, ut plures fideles, adhuc ancipites et pavidi, certam tutamque viam pro sua pietate inveniant, ad fovendam animarum salutem ad regnum Christi late propagandum! </p> <p>Ceteroquin apostolatus ita intellectus, uti haud difficulter coniicitur, non e naturali quodam ad agendum impulsu proficiscitur, sed e solida animi institutione efflorescit, fervido alitur amore erga Iesum Christum animasque eius sanguine pretioso redemptas, exerceturque, ad Magistri ipsius exemplum, assidue Deum precando, se ipsos abnegando, proximis benefaciendo. Hoc sane studium imitandi Christum explicabitur per varias apostolatus formas, in omni rerum condicione, ubicumque periclitantur animae vel divini Regis iura laeduntur, ita ut Actio Catholica proferatur ad omnia apostolatus opera, quae ad divinam Ecclesiae missionem quoquo modo attineant, salutarem vim suam exserens, non modo in cuiusque fidelis animo, verum etiam in domestico convictu, in scholarum disciplina, in civili ipsa consortione. </p> <p>Neque vero muneris amplitudo suadere vobis debet, ut numerum potius prosequamini, quam virtutem sociorum laboris; sed, quemadmodum Magister divinus post longam praeparationem paucos sane annos in apostolatu peregit, neque multos in Apostolicum collegium sociavit, sed lectos viros, qui Regnum ipsius in orbe terrarum constabilirent, ita et vos, Venerabiles Fratres, ante omnia curare debetis, ut Actionis Catholicae moderatores et praecones ad principia supernaturalia penitus conformentur, quin anxietate afficiamini, si principio « pusillus grex » (4) tantummodo exsistat. Et quoniam vos hanc rationem secutos iam esse pernovimus, paterne vobis gratulamur, quod selegistis prudenter accurateque instituistis idoneos socios, qui exemplo et verbo pietatis fervorem studiumque apostolatus in dioecesibus inque paroeciis late excitare queant. </p> <p>Vestrum eiusmodi opus non magno sonitu tubarumque clangore resultabit, sed sensim sine sensu laetos uberesque fructus suo tempore afferet; ad seminis instar, quod in occulto figit alte radices, gradatimque crescit usque ad arborem florentem patentemque. </p> <p>Institutio autem spiritualis interiorque vita, quas in vestris hisce adiutoribus fovendas curatis, impedient profecto, quominus iidem in subita incidant pericula, a rectaque via declinent. Inspecto enim supremo Catholicae Actionis fine, qui est, iuxta illud Evangelii « quaerite primum Regnum Dei » (5), animarum sanctificatio, numquam periculum aderit, ne finibus immediatis secundariisque principia ipsa posthabeantur, neque in oblivionem umquam dabitur, fini illi supremo opera quoque socialia et oeconomica, aliaque incepta caritatis, ordinate esse subiicienda. Hoc profecto nos docuit exemplo Iesus Christus, qui, quum ipsas corporum infirmitates sanaret, necessitatibusque naturalis vitae consuleret, liberalitatem divini Cordis effundens iis dictis « Misereor super turbam ... si dimisero ieiunos in domum suam, deficient in via » (6), semper ad supremum suae missionis finem spectavit, id est ad gloriam Patris sui, ad salutem animarum sempiternam. </p> <p>Neque igitur Actio Catholica negligere debet opera quae dicuntur socialia, quippe quae in rem deducant iustitiae caritatisve principia, aditumque praebeant, quum corporum necessitatibus occurrant miserorumque allevent aerumnas, ad animas plurimorum excolendas. Quod sane Nos Ipsi, ut Decessor Noster fel. rec. <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/latin/popes_latin/leo-xiii/latin_hf_leoxiii.html\">Leo XIII</a>, pluries commendavimus. Attamen, si Actio Catholica instruere debet idoneos socialium operum moderatores, qui ad normas et praescripta in Litteris Encyclicis statuta munera sua sustineant, ipsa quidem non debet sese implicare neque respondere de rationibus technicis, nummariis atque oeconomicis, quae fines et competentiam ipsius praetergrediuntur. </p> <p>Adversus vero criminationes, quae Ecclesiae crebro inferuntur, tamquam si ipsa iners sit aut incapax ad causas sociales solvendas, indesinenter instandum est, solam doctrinam operamque Ecclesiae, divino Conditore iugiter praesente, gravissimis malis humanum genus torquentibus mederi efficaciter posse. </p> <p>Vestrum itaque est, ut inceptis ipsis significastis, ex hisce frugiferis principiis certas deducere normas ad graves dirimendas in re sociali quaestiones, quae vestram patriam perturbant, ut quaestio agraria cum latifundiorum reductione, ut necessitas erigendi et recreandi, quoad vitae condiciones, omnes, qui labori incumbunt, eorumque familias. </p> <p>Integris quidem iuribus hominum primariis ac fundamentalibus, quod ad essentiam pertinet, ideoque salvo, exempli gratia, iure proprietatis, admonendum vobis est, bonum ipsum publicum quandoque expostulare, ut eiusmodi iura coangustentur, et saepius, quam in praeterito, iustitiae socialis normae in rem adducantur. Ad tuendam praeterea personae humanae dignitatem, urget aliquando officium aperte denuntiandi et reprobandi iniustas atque indignas vitae condiciones; at cavendum omnino est, hisce in casibus, ne, sub praetextu malis populi medendi, violentia approbetur, neve foveantur repentinae illae ac turbulentae saecularium societatis condicionum permutationes, quae exitus habeant funestiores malis ipsis, quibus sit occurrendum. Ad quaestiones sociales consilia et opera vestra impendentes, necessario quoque vos animos convertetis ad sortem tot miserorum opificum, qui, vehementer allecti splendidis utilitatum pollicitationibus, quae veluti praemia apostasiae proponuntur, a Deo eiusque Ecclesia haud raro deficiunt. </p> <p>Quod si opifices ex animo diligitis, — et singulariter iidem vobis diligendi sunt, quia per laboriosam vitam divino Magistro adsidue operoso dare assimilantur, — auxiliis tum temporalibus tum spiritualibus adesse illis debetis, sive efficiendo, ut eosdem tueatur iustitia commutativa et socialis, quae omni ope rationem vitae proletariorum allevet, sive iis largiendo religiosas vires et solamina, sine quibus ipsi in sordidum vilemque materiae cultum prolabuntur. </p> <p>Officium pariter grave atque urgentis necessitatis vobis incumbit, religiose nempe et oeconomice adsistendi iis, qui « campesinos » istic appellantur, itemque haud paucis filiis vestris, maiore ex parte agricolis, quibus populus Indorum constat. Sunt profecto innumerae animae, quas ipsas Christus Dominus redemit ac vestrae pastorali curae concredidit, de quibus aliquando a vobis rationem postulabit; sunt innumeri homines, qui tot vitae angustiis plerumque afflictantur, ut ne humanam quidem dignitatem possint tueri. Vos ergo obsecramus, Venerabiles Fratres, in visceribus caritatis Christi, ut peculiarem istorum curam habeatis, clerum praecipue urgendo, ut maiore in dies studio iisdem providere velit, Actionemque Catholicam inflammando ad hanc veluti redemptionem spiritualem ac temporalem persolvendam. </p> <p>Neque silentio premere possumus aliud quoque officium, quod postremis hisce annis maioris momenti videtur, curam scilicet Mexicanorum, qui in exteras terras demigravere; hi enim, a patriis terris moribusque avulsi, facilius nequam emissariorum praeda efficiuntnr, inque summo amittendae fidei periculo versantur. Si igitur consilia contuleritis cum vestris in Episcopatu fratribus, qui in Civitatibus Foederatis Americae Septentrionalis regunt Ecclesias tot piis operibus institutisque socialibus florentes, maiore sollicitudine atque industria remotis a patria fidelibus consultum erit. </p> <p>Quod si Actio Catholica humilibus classibus auxilioque maxime egentibus, ut opificum, agricolarum ac domo emigrantium, adesse et favere debet, nihilominus alios quoque campos excolere omnino tenetur. Itaque sollers cura adhibenda est de scholarum alumnis, qui ad liberales artes profitendas instruuntur atque interdum ad publicos honores apparantur, magnam plerumque auctoritatem in civili societate habituri. Propterea eiusmodi adulescentes, non modo, ut ceteri fideles, doctrina usuque ad christiana praecepta formandi sunt, verum altiore quoque disciplina atque educatione instituendi, nec non christiana roborandi philosophia, quae ad veritatem dicitur perennis. Hodie enim sincera ac religiosa institutio temporibusque respondens perquam necessaria videtur, inspecta tum contraria inque dies crebrescente aevi inclinatione ad ea, quae specie tenus aestimantur, tum repugnantia quotidie frequentiore ad cogitandum ad seque recolligendum, ita ut non pauci, in religiosis quoque officiis obeundis, subito potius animi affectu, quam mentis iudicio ducantur. </p> <p>Id igitur, quod Actio Catholica in aliis nationibus percommode facit, ut religiosa animorum institutio atque informatici inter litteratos adulescentes et laureatos catholicos primas partes habeat, valde optamus, ut etiam apud vos, congruenter ipsis patriae vestrae condicionibus ac necessitatibus, pro viribus efficiatur. </p> <p>Minime autem dubitamus, quin Universitatum studiorum alumni, Actioni Catholicae istic adscripti, Nostris votis optatisque plane respondeant. Isti enim, pro variis locorum adiunctis, alii aliam consociationis structuram mutuantes, tamquam selecta ac praevalida pars Catholicae ipsius Actionis, non modo spem portendunt aevi melioris, sed iam nunc de Ecclesia civilique societate egregie mereri possunt, seu quod apostolatum inter condiscipulos gerant, sive quod varias partes et multiplicia Actionis Catholicae instituta prudenter sagaciterque regant. </p> <p>Status ipse, qui nunc est, istius nationis Nobis suadet, ut ad memoriam vestram revocemus, quanto studio necesse sit aetatem tueri puerilem, cuius innocentiae tot struuntur insidiae, cuiusque morum ad christiana praescripta conformatiti perardua effecta est. Qua in re catholicis Mexicanis duo potissimum incumbunt officia: alterum, quod appellant, negativum, ut pueri ab impia et corruptrice schola omni virium contentione arceantur; alterum positivum, ut religiosa adsistentia instructioque iisdem sedulo praebeatur. De priore autem officio, tanti ponderis tantaeque difficultatis, mentem Nostrani iam nuper quoque significavimus. Quod attinet vero ad religiosam institutionem, licet vos sacris administris fidelibusque eam instanter iam commendasse pernovimus, tamen, pro summa huius rei necessitate, iterum vos commonefactos volumus, ut in omnibus dioecesibus, sicut in quibusdam tam laudabiliter fit, sacerdotes et sodales Actionis Catholicae, nulli curae laborique parcentes, acerrime intendant ad servandos Deo Ecclesiaeque eiusmodi parvulos, erga quos Salvator divinus tantam prae ceteris dilectionem apertissime tulit. </p> <p>Futura porro condicio puerorum atque adulescentium, qui nunc florent, — iterum vobis edicimus summa cum paterni cordis aegritudine, — Nos vehementer angit atque sollicitat. Manifesta sunt enim pericula, quibus nunc quum maxime pueritia atque adulescentia obiiciuntur, ubique sane gentium, at eo magis in Mexico, ubi tot scripta typis edita doctrinas religioni moribusque adversas late diffundunt, imperitosque iuvenes ad defectionem a Iesu Christo improbe impellunt. Quo itaque tanta ruina impediatur et pericula iuventae imminentia mature avertantur, statim adhibenda sunt legalia omnia adiumenta, ut Foedera, patrumfamilias, ut Comitatus moralitatis et vigilantiae circa scripta in vulgus edita, ut Comitatus censurae de rebus cinematographicis. </p> <p>Quo autem singuli arceantur a malo, nullum profecto tutius praesidium exstare videtur, ut experimenta ubique terrarum facta Nobis dare testantur, quam si ii Actioni Catholicae adscribantur, ubi praeclara virtutis et castimoniae habetur educatio, ubi peridonea christianae fortitudinis palaestra constituitur. Isti sane adulescentes, excelsa christianae vitae perfectione suaviter allecti, ac superno roborati auxilio, quod preces et suscepta sacramenta arcessunt, libenter alacriterque suorum sodalium animos Deo comparabunt, laetam fructuum segetem percepturi. </p> <p>Hoc plane confirmat, prae gravissimis Mexici necessitatibus, Catholicam Actionem nequaquam dici posse minoris momenti opus; ita ut si ipsa, quae animos ad officiorum conscientiam et ad virtutem informat, aliis operositatis generibus utcumque postponeretur, etiam si ageretur de libertatibus ordinis religiosi civilisque tuendis, miserandus error committeretur, quia Mexicanorum salus, sicut cuiusque humanae consociationis, imprimis posita est in doctrina Evangelii immutabili atque aeterna, inque moribus sincere integreque christianis. </p> <p>Proposita eiusmodi aestimandarum rerum mensura, concedendum sane est, ad christianam vitam explicandam, externa quoque subsidia, quae sensibus percipiuntur, esse necessaria, pariterque Ecclesiae, tamquam hominum societati, opus omnino esse, ad vitae usuram atque incrementum, iusta agendi libertate, ipsosque fideles iure gaudere in societate civili vivendi ad rationis conscientiaeque praescripta. </p> <p>Consequens ergo est, ut, quum nativae libertates ordinis religiosi civilisque impugnentur, cives catholici id perferre patique non possint. Attamen horum quoque iurium libertatumque vindicatio, pro diversis rerum adiunctis, magis vel minus opportuna, magis vel minus vehemens esse potest. </p> <p>Vos autem ipsi, Venerabiles Fratres, pluries fideles vestros docuistis, Ecclesiam, etiam cum gravi suo incommodo, pacis atque ordinis fautricem esse, omnemque iniustam rebellionem vel violentiam contra constitutas potestates condemnare. Ceterum apud vos affirmatum quoque est, si quando potestates ipsae iustitiam ac veritatem manifeste impugnent, ita ut vel fundamenta auctoritatis evertant, non videri cur improbari debeant cives illi, qui in unum coalescant ad tuendos semet ipsos nationemque servandam, licita atque idonea auxilia adhibentes contra eos, qui imperios abutantur ad rem publicam labefactandam. </p> <p>Quod si huius quaestionis solutio a singularibus rerum adiunctis necessario pendet, nonnulla tamen principia sunt in lumine collocanda: </p> <p>1. Vindicationes eiusmodi rationem medii seu finis relativi habent, non finis ultimi atque absoluti. </p> <p>2. Eaedem, tamquam media, esse debent actiones licitae, neque intrinsece malae. </p> <p>3. Quum ipsas ad finem idoneas et adaequatas esse oporteat, eatenus adhibendae sunt, quatenus ad propositum finem ex integro vel ex parte conducant, ita tamen, ut maiora damna communitati et iustitiae non afferant, quam ipsa damna resarcienda. </p> <p>4. Usus vero talium mediorum et plenum civilium politicorumque iurium exercitium, quum causas quoque ordinis mere temporalis technicique aut violentae defensionis complectantur, non attingunt directe munus Catholicae Actionis, licet ad eandem officium pertineat catholicos viros instruendi ad propria iura recte exercenda, eademque ex communis boni necessitate iustis modis vindicanda. </p> <p>5. Clerus et Actio Catholica, — quum ob missionem pacis amorisque sibi concreditam omnes homines « in vinculo pacis » (7) devincire teneantur, — plurium ad nationis prosperitatem conferre debent, tum civium classiumque coniunctionem maxime fovendo, tum obsecundando omnibus socialibus inceptis, quae a Christi doctrina moralique lege non discordent. </p> <p>Ceterum huiusmodi operositas Mexici catholicorum, claro nobilique consilio peracta, eo feliciores exitus consequetur, quo magis catholici ipsi ante oculos habebunt eam supernaturalis vitae cognitionem, religiosamque morum institutionem illudque ad Regnum Christi dilatandum studium, quae Actio Catholica tradenda sibi proponit. </p> <p>Si igitur fideles unanimes, libertatem sibi a Christo vindicatam (8) abdicare nolentes, inter se consociaverint, quae umquam humana potestas aut vis eos peccato mancipaverit? quodnam periculum, quaenam persecutio tam fortia pectora separaverint a caritate Christi? (9)</p> <p>Haec autem perfecti christiani civisque institutio, in qua vis supernaturalis cunctas eius dotes actionesque nobilitat atque extollit, multum quoque confert, ut facile intelligitur, ad civica et socialia officia recte, persolvenda. Contra hostes Ecclesiae iam ipse Augustinus fortiter affirmavit: « Qui doctrinam Christi adversam dicunt esse reipublicae ... dent tales provinciales, tales maritos, tales coniuges, tales parentes, tales filios, tales dominos, tales servos, tales reges, tales iudices ... quales esse praecipit doctrina christiana, et audeant eam dicere adversam esse reipublicae, immo vero dubitent confiteri magnam, si ei obtemperetur, salutem esse reipublicae » (10). </p> <p>Quapropter catholicus civis, quum de Ecclesiae patriaeque bono agatur, probe cavebit, verbi gratia, ne iure suffragii utendo abstineat; neque profecto umquam exstabunt Christi fideles, qui ad civilia et politica iura exercenda in plures disiungantur factiones, quandoque inter se miserabiliter contendentes, vel ecclesiasticae auctoritatis normis repugnantes. Ita enim augeretur confusio viriumque dissipatio in detrimentum Actionis Catholicae et causae ipsius, quae illis tuenda esset. </p> <p>Mentionem iam fecimus de inceptis, quae extra Catholicam Actionem sunt, quamvis cum ea minime discordantia, ut opera quae a partibus politicis vel ab institutis mere oeconomicis socialibusque absolvuntur. Sed plura alia exstant incepta atque consociationes, — ut Foedera patrumfamilias ad tuendam scholasticam libertatem religiosamque institutionem, Sodalitas civium ad familiam, nuptiarumque sanctitudinem moresque publicos integre servanda — quae per Actionem Catholicam explicari possunt, eiusque centrali moderamine fulciri. Quandoquidem Actio Catholica non in orbe quodam clauso versatur, sed veluti e fonte circum luce et calore latissime radiante, alia quoque incepta aliasque institutiones auxiliares congruenter disponit, quae, licet quadam autonomia iustaque agendi libertate ad particularem cuiusque finem necessaria fruantur, generales tamen normas regulasque communes sequantur oportet. Hoc praecipue expostulatur a vestra tam ampla natione, in qua propter locorum necessitatumque varietatem fieri potest, ut, integris communibus principiis, diversae structurae formae adlhibeantur, et aliae alibi eiusdem causae solutiones, aeque tamen iustae, re ipsa oriantur. </p> <p>Vestrum plane est, Venerabiles Fratres, quos Spiritus Sanctus posuit regere Ecclesiam Dei, quae in hisce casibus agenda sint pressius decernere, fideliumque vestrorum erit decretis vestris libenter fideliterque parere. Quod certe nobis magnopere cordi est, quia recta intentio atque oboedientia sunt, omni tempore omnique loco, condiciones prorsus necessariae ad superna auxilia pastorali officio Actionique Catholicae devocanda, sirmulque ad efficiendam communem quandam agendi rationem viriumque coniunctionem, sine quibus apostolatus omnino caret fecunditate. Obsecramus igitur etiam atque etiam probos Mexici catholicos, ut oboedientiam ac disciplinam diligant colantque: « Oboedite praepositis vestris et subiacete eis. Ipsi enim pervigilant, quasi rationem pro animabus vestris reddituri » (11). Hilaris autem esto oboedientia, ad virtutes optimas excitatrix. Qui enim aegre, veluti coactus, oboedit, internam animi, indignationem effundens in acerbas censuras adversus praepositos laborumque socios, et contra ea quae ipsius optatis repugnent, divinos favores avertit, disciplinae frangit robur et ubi est aedificandum destruit. </p> <p>Praeter oboedientiam et disciplinam memorare Nobis placet alia quoque universae caritatis officia, in ipso capite quarto epistulae S. Pauli ad Ephesios, de quo supra mentionem fecimus, declarata, quae Actionis Catholicae sociis, tamquam norma praecipua, proferenda videntur: « Obsecro itaque vos ego vinctus in Domino, ut digne ambuletis .., cum omni humilitate et mansuetudine, cum patientia, supportantes invicem in caritate, solliciti servare unitatem Spiritus in vinculo pacis. Unum corpus et unus Spiritus » (12). </p> <p>Carissimos ergo Mexici filios, qui tantam curarum sollicitudinumque Nostri Pontificatus partem constituunt, rursus vehementerque adhortamur ad unitatem, ad caritatem, ad pacem, in laborioso apostolatu Catholicae Actionis, quae Mexico Christum restituet ac terrenam insuper conciliabit prosperitatem. </p> <p>Nostra eiusmodi vota Nostrasque preces ad pedes reverenter deponimus caelestis vestrae Patronae, quam sub titulo Nostrae Dominae <em>de Guadalupe</em> invocatis, quaeque in celeberrimo Sanctuario isto boni cuiusque Mexicani amorem et venerationem iugiter excitat. Deiparam ipsam, quae sub eodem titulo pie recolitur in alma Urbe, in qua Nos paroeciam quoque in eius honorem condidimus, impense efflagitamus, ut Nostris vestrisque votis materna gratia obsecundans, a Deo omnipotenti omnia fausta ac felicia Mexico obtineat cum pace Christi in Regno Christi. </p> <p>Hoc quidem animo, hac fiducia erecti, vobis, Venerabiles Fratres, vestris sacerdotibus, Actionis Catholicae sociis, omnibus fidelibus, nec non universae nobili Mexicanae nationi, Apostolicam Benedictionem effusa in Domino caritate impertimus. </p> <p>Esto Nostra haec Epistula, in Paschate Christi Resurrectionis data, pignus spiritualis patriae vestrae resurrectionis auspiciumque paternum, ita ut, quemadmodum vos passionis Christi socii fuistis, aeque sitis participes eiusdem resurrectionis. </p> <p><i>Datum Romae apud Sanctum Petrum, die XXVIII mensis Martii, Dominica Resurrectionis Domini Nostri Iesu Christi, anno MDCCCCXXXVII, Pontificatus Nostri setto decimo. </i> </p> <p align=\"center\"> </p> <p align=\"center\"><b>PIUS PP.
