Day after day We deplore more deeply the unhappy lot of those who aredeprived of the fullness of the Christian Faith. Wherefore moved by the sense ofthe responsibility which Our most sacred office entails, and by the spirit andgrace of the most loving Saviour of men, Whom We unworthily represent, We areconstantly imploring them to agree at last to restore together with Us thecommunion of the one and the same faith. A momentous work, and of all humanworks the most difficult to be accomplished; one which God's almighty poweralone can effect. But for this very reason We do not lose heart, nor are Wedeterred from Our purpose by the magnitude of the difficulties which cannot beovercome by human power alone. \"We preach Christ crucified . . . and theweakness of God is stronger than men\" (1 Cor. i. 23-25). In the midst</font><font size=\"3\">of so many errors and of so many evils with which We are afflicted orthreatened, We continue to point out whence salvation should be sought,exhorting and admonishing all nations to lift up \"their eyes to themountains whence help shall come\" (Ps. cxx.). For indeed that which Isaiasspoke in prophecy has been fulfilled, and the Church of God stands forth soconspicuously by its Divine origin and authority that it can be distinguished byall beholders: \"And in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lordshall be prepared on the top of mountains and shall be exalted above thehills\" (Is. ii. 2).</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">2. Scotland, so dear to the Holy See, and in a special manner to Us, has itsplace in Our care and solicitude. We love to recall the fact that over twentyyears ago the first act of Our Apostolic Ministry was performed in favour ofScotland, for on the second day of our Pontificate We gave back to the Scottishpeople their Ecclesiastical Hierarchy. From that day forward, with yourefficient co-operation, Venerable Brethren, and that of your clergy, We haveconstantly sought to promote the welfare of your nation, which is naturallyinclined to embrace the truth. And now that We are so far advanced in years thatthe end cannot be delayed much longer, We have thought it meet to address you,Venerable Brethren, and</font><font size=\"3\">thus give your nation a further proof of Our Apostolic affection.</font> </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">3. The terrible storm which swept over the Church in the sixteenth century,deprived the vast majority of the Scottish people, as well as many other peoplesof Europe, of that Catholic Faith which they had gloriously held for over onethousand years. It is most pleasing to Us to revert to the great achievements ofyour forefathers on behalf of Catholicism, and also to allude to some of those,and they are many, to whose virtue and illustrious deeds Scotland owes so muchof her renown. Surely your fellow-countrymen will not take it ill that We shouldagain remind them of what they owe to the Catholic Church and to the ApostolicSee. We speak of what you already know. As your ancient Annals relate, St.Ninian, a countryman of yours, was so inflamed with the desire of greaterspiritual progress by the reading of Holy Writ, that he exclaimed: \"I shallrise and go over sea and land, seeking that truth which my soul loveth. But isso much trouble needful? Was it not said to Peter: `Thou are Peter and upon thisrock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail againstit?' Therefore in the faith of Peter there is nothing wanting, nothing obscure,nothing imperfect, nothing against which evil doctrines and pernicious views canprevail, after the manner of the gates of hell. And where is the faith of Peter,but in the See of Peter? Thither, thither I must repair, that going forth frommy country, from my kindred, and from my father's house, I may see in the landof the Vision the will of the Lord and be protected by His Temple.\" (<i>Ex Hist. Vitae S. Niniani a S. Aelredo Ab. cons.</i>) Hence, full of reverence hehastened to Rome, and when at the Tomb of the Apostles he had imbibed inabundance Catholic truth at its very source and fountainhead, by command of theSupreme Pontiff he returned home, preached the true Roman faith to hisfellow-countrymen, and founded the Church of Galloway about two hundred yearsbefore St. Augustine landed in England. This was the faith of St. Columba; thiswas the faith kept so religiously and preached so zealously by the monks of old,whose chief centre, Iona, was rendered famous by their eminent virtues. Need Wemention Queen Margaret, a light and ornament not only of Scotland, but of thewhole of Christendom, who, though she occupied the most exalted position inpoint of worldly dignity,</font><font size=\"3\">sought only in her whole life things eternal and divine, and thus spread throughout the Church the luster of her virtues? There can be no doubt she owed this her eminent sanctity to the influence and guidance of the Catholic Faith. And did not the power and constancy of the Catholic faith give to Wallace and Bruce, the two great heroes of your race, their indomitable courage in defence of their country? We say nothing of the immense number of those who achieved so much for the commonwealth, and who belong to that progeny which the Catholic Church has never ceased to bring forth. We say nothing of the advantages which your nation has derived from her influence. It is undeniable that it was through her wisdom and authority that those famous seats of learning were opened at St. Andrews, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, and that your judicial system was drawn up and adopted. Hence We can well understand why Scotland has been honoured by the title of \"Special Daughter of the Holy See.\"</font> </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">4. But since then a great change has come to pass, the ancient faith having beenextinguished in the minds of the vast majority of your countrymen. Are we tosuppose that it will never be restored? There are indeed some signs which leadUs to hope that, by the grace of God, a brighter religious future awaits theScotch people. We see that Catholics are more liberally and kindly dealt with astime goes on, that Catholic doctrines are no longer publicly held up to scorn,as perhaps was formerly the case, but on the contrary are favourably consideredby many, and accepted by not a few. We also perceive that false views andopinions, which effectively prevent the perception of truth, are graduallydisappearing. May the search after truth spread more, for there is no doubt thatan accurate knowledge of the Catholic Religion, drawn from its own, and not fromextraneous, sources, will clear away many prejudices.</font> </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">5. Great praise is due to the Scottish nation, as a whole, that they have always shown reverence and love for the Inspired Writings. They cannot therefore be unwilling to listen to a few words which in Our affection We would address to them on this subject with a view to their eternal welfare; since We find that in revering the Sacred Scriptures, they are in agreement with the Catholic Church. Why then should this not be the starting-point for a return to unity? We</font> <font size=\"3\">beg them to remember that they have the Books of the Old Covenant and of the Newfrom the Catholic Church and from the Catholic Church alone. If these InspiredWritings have passed unscathed through the many and dangerous vicissitudes ofcenturies, such a blessing is to be attributed to her never-failing vigilanceand unceasing care. History attests that in the early ages of the Church theintegrity of the Scriptures was preserved by the ever-memorable efforts of theThird Synod at Carthage and of Innocent I, the Roman Pontiff. At a later time noless watchfulness was shown, as we know, by Eugenius IV and by the Council ofTrent. We Ourselves, not unmindful of the necessities of the present day,published a short while ago an Encyclical Letter in which We gravely addressedthe Bishops of the Catholic world and diligently admonished them as to the meansto be adopted in order to safeguard the integrity and the Divine authority ofthe Sacred Writings. For owing to the restlessness of modern thought, there aremany whom the inordinate desire of superciliously inquiring into everything, andcontempt for antiquity, pervert to such a degree, that they either refuse allauthority to Holy Writ, or at least seriously curtail and minimize it. Thesemen, puffed up by an exaggerated estimate of their own knowledge, and having anoverweening trust in their own judgment, fail to perceive how rash and monstrousit is to try to measure the works of God by our own puny intelligence; nor dothey sufficiently heed St. Augustine's warning: \"Honour God's Scripture,honour God's Word though not understood, reverently wait in order tounderstand\" (in Ps. 146, n. 12). \"Those who study the VenerableScriptures ought to be admonished . . . that they must pray in order tocomprehend.\" (Doct. Chr. lib. iii., c. 37, n. 56.) \"Lest anythingunknown be rashly asserted as known . . . let nothing be rashly asserted, butall things cautiously and modestly examined\" (in Gen. Op. Imp.).</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">6. But as the Church was to last to the end of time, something more was required besides the bestowal of the Sacred Scriptures. It was obviously necessary that the Divine Founder should take every precaution, lest the treasure of heavenly-given truths, possessed by the Church, should ever be destroyed, which would assuredly have happened, had He left those doctrines to each one's private judgment. It stands to reason,</font> <font size=\"3\">therefore, that a living, perpetual \"magisterium\" was necessary in theChurch from the beginning, which, by the command of Christ himself, shouldbesides teaching other wholesome doctrines, give an authoritative explanation ofHoly Writ, and which being directed and safeguarded by Christ himself, could byno means commit itself to erroneous teaching. God has provided for these needsmost wisely and effectively through His Only-begotten Son Jesus Christ, Whoplaced the true sense of the Scriptures in safety, when He laid upon HisApostles as His primary and most momentous injunction, not to devote themselvesto writing, nor to spreading the volumes of the Old Testament indiscriminatelyand unguardedly among the multitude, but to teach all nations with the livingvoice, and to lead them by speech to the knowledge and profession of HisHeavenly doctrine: \"Going into the whole world preach the Gospel to everycreature.\" (Mark xvi. 15.) But the supreme teaching authority was committedto one, on whom, as on its foundation, the Church must rest. For Christ when Hegave the keys to Peter, gave him at the same time the power to govern those whowere charged with the \"ministry of the word:\" \"Confirm thyBrethren\" (Luke xxii. 32). And since the faithful must learn from the\"magisterium\" of the Church whatever pertains to the salvation oftheir souls, it follows that they must also learn from it the true meaning ofScripture.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">7. It is easy to perceive how unsafe, how inadequate, and how useless is the method propounded by those who think that the only way to interpret Scripture is by the help of Scripture itself. For on that principle the ultimate law of interpretation would rest with the individual judgment. But, as we have already stated, each one will undertake the reading of Scripture with entirely different feelings, views, and prepossessions, and will interpret God's written Word accordingly. The result will be that those divergent interpretations will necessarily produce discussions and disputes, and thus turn what was intended as a source of union and peace into a source of contention and strife.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">8. The truth of what We have just stated is proven by what has actually takenplace since, of all the sects, deprived as they are of the Catholic Faith anddisagreeing among themselves on religious matters, each one claims that its ownteaching and practices are in accord with Holy</font><font size=\"3\">Writ. There is no gift of God so sacred, that man cannot abuse it to his own detriment; since, according to the stern warning of Blessed Peter, \"the unlearned and unstable wrest\" the very Scriptures \"to their own destruction\" (2 Peter iii., 16). Hence Irenaeus, who lived shortly after the Apostolic age, and who is a faithful interpreter of Apostolic doctrine, always taught that a knowledge of the truth could only be had from the living voice of the Church: \"Where the Church is, there is the Spirit of God, and where the spirit of God is found, there is the Church and all grace, and the Spirit is truth\" - (Adv. Haer. lib. iii.). \"Where, therefore, the gifts of God are placed, it is necessary to learn the truth from those who have in the Church the Apostolic Succession\"- (Adv. Haer. lib. iv.). And if Catholics, who may differ on all other matters, are found united in marvellous concord in the faith, there can be no doubt that this is chiefly owing to the authority and power of the \"magisterium.\"</font> </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">9. We know that many of the Scottish people, who do not agree with us in faith,sincerely love the name of Christ, and strive to ascertain His doctrine and toimitate His most holy example. But how can they obtain what they are strivingfor, if they do not allow themselves to be taught heavenly things in the wayprescribed by Jesus Christ Himself; if they do not give heed to the Church whoseprecepts they are commanded to obey by the Author of faith as if they were Hisown: \"He who heareth you heareth me; he who despiseth you despisethme\"; if they do not seek the nourishment of their souls, and the sustenanceof all virtue, from him whom the Supreme Pastor of souls made His vicegerent, towhom He confided the care of the universal Church? In the meantime We areresolved not to fail in doing Our share, and especially to be constant infervent prayer, that God may move their minds to what is good, and vouchsafe toimpart to them the most powerful impulses of His grace. May the Divine clemency,thus earnestly implored by Us, grant to the Church that supreme consolation ofspeedily embracing the whole Scottish people, restored to the faith of theirforefathers \"in spirit and in truth.\" What incalculable blessingswould not accrue to them, if they were once more united to us? Perfect andabsolute truth would everywhere shine forth, together with the inestimable giftswhich were</font><font size=\"3\">forfeited by separation. There is one amongst all others, the loss of which is more deplorable than words can express; We allude to the most holy Sacrifice in which Jesus Christ, both Priest and Victim, daily offers Himself to His Father, through the ministry of His priests on earth. By virtue of this Sacrifice the infinite merits of Christ, gained by His Precious Blood shed once upon the Cross for the salvation of men, are applied to our souls. This belief prevailed among the Scottish people in St. Columba's day and in subsequent ages, when your grand and majestic cathedrals were raised throughout the land, which still testify to the art and piety of your ancestors.</font> </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">10. Now the very essence of Religion implies Sacrifice. For the perfection ofDivine Worship is found in the submissive and reverent acknowledgment that Godis the Supreme Lord of all things, by Whose power we and all our belongingsexist. This constitutes the very nature of Sacrifice, which, on this account, isemphatically called a \"thing Divine.\" If Sacrifices are abolished,Religion can neither exist nor be conceived. The Evangelical Law is notinferior, but superior, to the Old Law. It brings to perfection what the Old Lawhad merely begun. But the Sacrifice of the Cross was prefigured by thesacrifices of the Old Covenant long before the Birth of Jesus Christ; and afterHis Ascension, the same Sacrifice is continued by the Eucharistic Sacrifice.They greatly err, therefore, who reject this doctrine, as if it diminished thereality and efficacy of the Sacrifice which Christ offered on the Cross. He\"was offered once to exhaust the sins of many\" (Heb. ix., 28). Thatatonement for the sins of men was absolutely complete: nor is there any otheratonement besides that of the Cross in the Eucharistic Sacrifice. As Religionmust ever be accompanied by a sacrificial rite, it was the Divine counsel of theRedeemer that the Sacrifice of the Cross should be perpetuated. This perpetuityis in the most Holy Eucharist, which is not an empty similitude or a merecommemoration, but the very Sacrifice flows from the death of Christ: \"Forfrom the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name is great among theGentiles, and in every place there is sacrifice, and there is offered to my namea clean oblation: for my name is great among the Gentiles\" (Mal. i. 2).</font> </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">11. It remains for Us now to address the</font> <font size=\"3\">Catholics in a more special manner, and We do so in order that they shouldco-operate with Us in realizing what We have at heart. Christian charity bidseach one labour, according to his opportunities, for the salvation of his fellowmen. We therefore call upon them first of all constantly to offer prayers andsupplications to God, Who alone can give the necessary light to the minds ofmen, and dispose their wills as He pleases. And furthermore, as example is mostpowerful, let them show themselves worthy of the truth which through Divinemercy they possess, and let them recommend the faith which they hold by edifyingand stainless lives. \"So let your light shine before men, that they may seeyour good works\" (Matth. v., 16). Let them at the same time distinguishthemselves by the practice of virtue in public life, so that it should be moreand more clearly shown that Catholicism cannot be said, without calumny, to runcounter to the interests of the State: but that, on the contrary, nothing elsecontributes so much to the honourable and successful discharge of social duties.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">12. It is likewise of vital importance to defend most strenuously, to establish more firmly, and to surround with every safeguard, the Catholic education of youth. We are not unmindful of the fact that in Scotland thoroughly efficient schools exist, in which the best method of teaching is to be found. But every effort must be put forth, and every sacrifice must be made, so that Catholic schools should be second to none in point of efficiency. We must not allow our youth to be inferior to others in literary attainments, or in learning, which the Christian faith demands as its honourable accompaniments with a view to its defence and adornment. The love of Religion and country requires that whatever institutions Catholics already possess for the purposes of primary, intermediate, or higher education, should, by the due and proportionate cooperation of all, be consolidated and extended. Justice similarly demands that the education and training of the clergy should be most zealously promoted, as they cannot now-a-days occupy worthily and usefully their position, unless they have the prestige of wide erudition and solid learning. In this connection, We can find no institution more worthy of being recommended than Blahs College. An excellent and noble work, begun with exceptional zeal and generosity by</font> <font size=\"3\">one devoted Catholic, this institution should not be allowed to decline anddisappear by neglect, but should be sustained by a similar charity, andcompleted as soon as possible. This will be tantamount to making provision thatfor nearly the whole of Scotland, priests will be trained and educated accordingto the needs of the present time.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">13. All these things, Venerable Brethren, which Our affection for the Scottish people has suggested to Us, we commend to your thoughtfulness and charity. Continue to exercise that zeal of which you have given Us such abundant proof, so that everything may be effected which may conduce to the realization of what we have in view. The matter in hand is extremely difficult, and one the accomplishment of which, as We have repeatedly stated, surpasses all human efforts; but it is most holy and desirable, and in perfect harmony with the counsels of Divine Goodness. Wherefore, We are not so much deterred by the difficulties, as We are encouraged by the conviction that the Divine help will not fail, if you devote yourselves to the fulfilment of these Our wishes and behests.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">14. As a pledge of Divine grace, and as a token of Our fatherly affection, Welovingly impart to you, in the Lord, Venerable brethren, to your clergy andpeople our Apostolic Blessing.</font> </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\"><i>Given at St. Peter's, Rome, the 25th day of July, in the year 1898, and the twenty-first of Our Pontificate.</i></font> </p>\n<p align=\"center\"><font size=\"3\"><b>LEO XIII</b></font> </p>\n<p align=\"center\"> </p>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\" size=\"3\">© Copyright 1898 - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><font size=\"3\"><i>     </i></font></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"content parsys\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>",

II, 2). </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Huiusmodi in curis consiliisque Nostris suum obtinet Scotia locum, quam Apostolicae huic Sedi diu multumque dilectam, Nos ipsi proprio quodam nomine caram habemus. Ante annos viginti, libet enim commemorare, Apostolici ministerii in Scotis dedicavimus primitias, cum altero ab inito Pontificatus die ecclesiasticam apud ipsos hierarchiam restituendam curavimus. Quo ex tempore praeclare vobis, Venerabiles Fratres, vestroque adnitente clero, numquam non bono studuimus istius gentis, quam quidem sua indoles amplectendae veritati peridoneam facit. Nunc vero quoniam, id aetatis sumus, ut propius iam absit humanus exitus, etiam visum est alioqui vos, Venerabiles Fratres, populoque vestro novum Apostolicae providentiae documentum impertire. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Turbolentissima illa tempestas, quae in Ecclesiam saeculo decimo sexto incubuit, sicut alios nimium multos per Europam, ita Scotos maximam partem abstraxit a fide catholica, quam plus mille annis cum gloria retinuerant. Gratum Nobis est cogitatione repetere maiorum vestrorum in rem catholicam non exigua promerita: itemque libet eos recordari, nec sane paucos, quorum virtute rebusque gestis Scotiae nomen inclaruit. At vero num hodie cives vestri abnuant meminisse vicissim, quid Ecclesiae catholicae, quid Apostolicae Sedi debeant? Cognita vobis planeque explorata commemoramus. — Est in vetustis annalibus vestris, Ninianum, hominem Scotum, cum ipsum legendis sacris litteris acrius cepisset studium in spiritu proiiciendi, dixisse: « Surgam, circuibo mare et aridam, quaeram « veritatem quam diligit anima mea. Itane tantis opus est? Nonne « Petro dictum est: <i>Tu es Petrus, et super ha ne petram aedificabo Ecclesiam meam, et portae inferi non praevalebunt adversus eam </i>? Igitur in fide Petri nihil minus est, nihil obscurum, nihil imperfectum, nihil adversum quod doctrinae nequam sententiaeque perversae, quasi portae inferi, praevalere « sufficiant. Et ubi fides Petri nisi in sede Petri? Illuc certe, « illuc mihi eundum est, ut exiens de terra mea et de cognatione mea et de domo patris mei rherear in terra visionis videre voluntatem Domini et protegi a templo eius » ( Excerpta ex historia vitae S. Niniaai, Episcopi Candidae Gasae seu Gallovidiae in Scotia, a S. Aelredo abbate Rievallensi conscripta). Itaque Romam venerabundus propera vit; cumque ad sepulcra Apostolorum de ipso fonte et capite catholicae veritatis large accepisset, iussu mandatoque Pontificis maximi domum reversus, romanae fidei documentis cives imbuit, Ecclesiamque Gallovidiensem condidit, duobus ante saeculis, quam beatus Augustinus ad Anglos appulit. Hanc fidem S. Columba, hanc ipsam veteres monachi, quorum est Ionensis sedes tam claris nobilitata virtutibus, et ipsi summo servarunt obsequio et alios diligentissime edocuerunt. Quid Margaritam reginam memoremus, non Scotiae tantummodo, sed christiani nominis universi lumen et decus? quae in rerum mortalium collocata fastigio, cum nihil tamen nisi immortale ac divinum in omni vita spectavisset, suarum splendore virtutum orbem terrarum implevit. Iamvero si tantam excellentiam sanctitatis attigit, catholicae fidei afflatu impulsuque attigit. Wallacem vero Brucemque, lumina vestri generis, nonne constantia catholicae fidei fortissimos patriae propugnatores praestitit? Mittimus innumerabiles alios utilissimi os reipublicae cives, quos Ecclesia parens educere numquam destitit.

Numquamne excitatum iri censebimus? Imo vero certa quaedam apparent indicia rerum quae spem bonam de Scotis, adiuvante Deo, inchoare iubeant. Videmus enim lenius quotidie benigniusque haberi catholicos; dogmatis catholicae sapientiae iam non, ut fortasse antea, contemptum vulgo adhiberi, sed favorem a multis, obsequium a non paucis; perversitates opinionum, quae nimium quantum impediunt iudicium veri, sensim obsolescere. Atque utinam vigeat latius pervestigatio veritatis; neque enim dubitandum, quin auctior notitia religionis catholicae, germana nimirum suisque e fontibus, non ex alienis petita, praeiudicatas eiusmodi opiniones penitus ex animis abstergat. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Scotis universis ea quidem tribuenda laus non mediocris, quod divinas litteras colere et revereri assiduo consueverunt.

Videlicet in ea, quam diximus, verecundia sacrarum litterarum inest velut quaedam cum Ecclesia catholica consensio: quidni queat redintegrandae unitatis initium aliquando existere? Ne recusent meminisse, utriusque Testamenti libros se ab Ecclesia catholica, non aliunde, accepisse : cuius vigilantiae perpetuisque curis acceptum referendum, quod sacrae litterae maximas temporum ac rerum procellas integrae evasere. — Historia testatur iam inde antiquitus de Scripturarum incolumitate Synodum Garthaginiensem Iii atque Innocentium I romanum pontificem immortaliter meruisse. Recentiore vero memoria cogniti sunt tum Eugenii IV, tum Concilii Tridentini vigiles in eodem genere labores. Nos autem ipsi, haud ignari temporum, datis non ita pridem litteris encyclicis, Episcopos catholici orbis gravissime appellavimus, diligenterque monuimus quid opus esset facto, ut integritas ac divina auctoritas sacrarum litterarum salva consisteret. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Nam, in hoc praecipiti ingeniorum cursu, sunt plures quos libido fastidiosius quaelibet disquirendi, contemptioque vetustatis ita agat transversos, ut fidem sacro volumini vel elevare omnem, vel certe minuere non dubitent. Nimirum homines opinione scientiae infilati, iudicioque praefidentes suo, non intelligunt quam sit improbae temeritatis plenum, humano prorsus modulo metiri quae Dei sunt opera; eoque minus audiunt Augustinum alte clamantem : « Honora Scripturam Dei, honora «verbum Dei etiam non apertum, differ pietate intelligentiam » (In Ps. 146, n. 12). « Admonendi sunt studiosi venerabilium litterarum orent ut intelligant » (Doctr. Chr. lib. III, c. 37, n. 56). « Ne aliquid temere et incognitum pro cognito asserant Nihil temere esse affirmandum, seu caute omnia modesteque tractanda » ( In Gen. Op. Imp.). Verumtamen cum Ecclesiam perpetuo mansuram esse oporteret, non solis ea Scripturis, sed alio quodam praesidio instrui debuit. Scilicet divini auctoris fuit illud cavere, nequando caelestium doctrinarum thesaurus in Ecclesia dissipatus deficeret; id quod necessitate futurum erat, si eum singulorum hominum arbitrio permisisset. Opus igitur fuisse apparet ab initio Ecclesiae magisterium aliquod vivum et perenne, cui ex Christi auctoritate demandata esset cum salutifera ceterarum rerum doctrina, tum interpretatio certa Scripturarum; quodque, assiduo Christi ipsius auxilio munitum ac septum, nullo modo delabi in errorem docendo posset. Cui rei sapientissime Deus cumulateque providit, idque per unigenitum Filium suum Iesum Christum: qui scilicet germanam Scripturarum interpretationem tum in tuto posuit cum Apostolos suos in primis et maxime iussit, nequaquam dare scriptioni operam neque vuigo diribere vetustiorum Scripturarum, sine discrimine, sine lege, volumina, sed omnino edocere gentes viva voce universas, et ad cognitionem professionemque doctrinae caelestis, alloquendo, perducere: <i>Euntes in mundum universum praedicate Evangelium omni creaturae</i> (Marc. XVI<b>, </b> 15). — Principatum autem docendi contulit uni, quo tamquam fundamento universitatem Ecclesiae docentis niti oporteret Christus enim cum claves regni caelorum Petro traderet, una simul ei dedit ceteros regere, qui ministerio verbi fungerentur: <i>Confirma fratres tuos</i> (Luc. XXII, 32). Hoc itaque magisterio cum discere fideles debeant quaecumque ad salutem pertinent, ipsam petant divinorum librorum intelligentiam necesse est. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Facile autem apparet quam incerta sit et manca et inepta proposito eorum ratio, qui Scripturarum sensum unice ipsarum Scripturarum ope vestigari posse existimant. Nam eo dato, suprema lex interpretandi in iudicio denique consistet singulorum. Iamvero, quod supra attigimus, prout quisque comparatus animo, ingenio, studiis, moribus ad legendum accesserit, ita divinorum sententiam eloquiorum iisdem de rebus interpretantur. Hinc discrepantia interpretandi dissimilitudinem sentiendi contentionesque gignat necesse est, converso in materiam mali, quod unitati concordiaeque bono datum erat. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Quae quidem quam vere dicamus, res loquitur ipsa. Nam omnes catholicae fidei expertes atque inter se dissentientes de religione sectae, id sibi singulae sumunt ut omnino placitis institutisque suis suffragari sacras litteras contendant. Adeo nullum est tam sanctum Dei donum, quo non abuti ad perniciem suam homo queat, quandoquidem divinas ipsas Litteras, quod gravi sententia monuit beatus Petrus, <i>indocti et instabiles depravant ad suam ipsorum perclitionem</i> (II Petr. III, 10). His de causis Irenaeus, recens ab aetate Apostolorum idemque fidus eorum interpres, inculcare hominum mentibus numquam destitit, non aliunde accipi notitiam veritatis, quam ex viva ecclesiae institutione oportere: « Ubi enim Ecclesia, ibi et Spiritus Dei, et « ubi Spiritus Dei illic Ecclesia et omnis gratia; Spiritus autem veritas (Adv. Haer. lib. III)... Ubi igitur charismata Domini posita sunt, ibi discere oportet veritatem apud quos est ea quae est ab Apostolis Ecclesiae successio » (Adv. Haer. lib, IV). — Quod si catholici, quamvis in genere civilium rerum non ita coniuncti, connexi tamen aptique inter se unitate fidei mirabili tenentur, minime est dubium quin huius praecipue magisterii virtute et ope teneantur. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Scotorum nobiscum de fide dissidentium complures quidem Christi nomen ex animo diligunt, eiusque et disciplinam assequi et exempla sanctissima persequi imitando nituntur. At qui mente qui animo unquam adipisci poterunt quod laborant, nisi erudiri sese atque ali ad caelestia eâ ratione et via patiantur, qua Christus ipse constituit? nisi dicto audientes Ecclesiae sint, cui praecipienti ipse auctor fidei perinde obtemperan homines iussit ac sibi: <i>Qui vos audit, me audit; qui vos spernit, me spernit?</i> nisi requirant alimenta pietatis virtutumque omnium ex eo, cui Pastor summus animarum vicario dedit esse sui muneris, universi gregis cura concredita? Interea certum Nobis est Nostris non deesse partibus; imprimisque supplices contendere a Deo, ut inclinans ad bonum mentibus velit potiora gratiae suae incitamenta adiicere. Atque utinam divina Nobis exorata benignitas hoc Ecclesiae matri solatium optatissimum largiatur, ut Scotos universos ad fidem avitam <i>in spiritu et veritate</i> restituios complecti celeriter queat. Quid non ipsis sperandum, reconciliata nobiscum concordia? Confestim effulgeret undique perfecta et absoluta veritas cum possessione bonorum maximorum, quae secessione interferant. Quibus in bonis longe excellit unum, quo miserrimum est carere: sacrificium sanctissimum dicimus, in quo Iesus Christus, sacerdos idem et victima, Patri suo se offert ipse quotidie, ministerio suorum in terris sacerdotum. Cuius virtute sacrificii infinita nobis Christi applicantur merita nimirum divino cruore parta, quem actus in crucem pro salute hominum semel effudit. Harum fides rerum florebat integra apud Scotos, quo tempore S. Columba mortale agebat aevum: itemque postea cum templa maxima passim excitarentur, quae maiorum vestrorum excellentiam et artis et pietatis posteritati testantur. — Necessitatem vero sacrificii vis ipsa et natura religionis continet. In hoc enim est summa divini cultus agnoscere et revereri Deum ut supremum dominatorem rerum, cuius in potestate et nos et omnia nostra sunt. Iamvero non alia est ratio et causa sacrificii, quae propterea res divinato prie nominatur: remotisque sacrificiis, nulla nec esse, nec cogitari religio potest. Lege veteri non est lex inferior Evangelii: imo multo praestantior, quia id cumulate perfecit, quod illa inchoarat. Iamvero sacrificium in Cruce factum praesignificabant sacrificia in Testamento veteri usitata, multo ante quam Christus nasceretur: post eius ascensum in caelum, idem illud sacrificium sacrificio eucharistico continuatur. Itaque vehementer errant, qui hoc perinde respuunt, ac si veritatem virtutemque sacrificii deminuat, quod Christus, cruci suffixus, fecit; <i>semel oblatus ad multorum exhaurienda peccata </i>(Hebr. IX, 28). Omnino perfecta atque absoluta illa expiatio mortalium fuit: nec ullo modo altera, sed ipsa illa in sacrificio eucharistico inest. Quoniam enim sacrificalem ritum comitari in omne tempus religioni oportebat, divinissimum fuit Redemptoris consilium ut sacrificium semel in Cruce consummatum, perpetuum et perenne fieret. Huius autem ratio perpetuitatis inest in sacratissima Eucharistia, quae non similitudinem inanem memoriamve tantum rei affert, sed veritatem ipsam, quamquam specie dissimili: proptereaque huius sacrificii efficientia sive ad impetrandum, sive ad expiandum, ex morte Christi tota fluit: <i>Ab ortu enim solis usque ad occasum, magnum est nomen meum in gentibus: et in omni loco saerificatur, et offertur nomini meo oblatio munda: quia magnum est nomen meum in gentibus</i> (Mal. I, 11). </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Iam, quod reliquum est, ad eos qui catholicum nomen profitentur Nostra propius spectat oratio: idque Ob eam causam, ut proposito Nostro prodesse aliquid opera sua velint. Studere, quoad quisque potest, proximorum saluti christiana caritas iubet. Quamobrem ab eis primum omnium petimus, ut huius rei gratia orare atque obsecrare Deum ne desinant, qui lumen efficax mentibus affundere, voluntatesque impellere quo velit, solus potest. Deinde, quia ad flectendos animos plurimum exempla possunt, dignos se ipsi praestent veritate, cuius divino munere sunt compotes; ac bene moratae instituto vitae adiiciant commendationem fidei, quam profitentur: <i>Luceat lux vestra coram hominibus, ut videant opera vestra bona</i> (Matth. V, 16): unaque simul civilium exercitatione virtutum efficiant, ut illud quotidie magis appareat, religionem catholicam inimicam civitati, nisi per calumniam, traduci non posse: quin imo alia in re nulla plus reperiri ad dignitatem commodumque publicum praesidii. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Illud etiam magnopere expedit, tueri religiosissime, imo etiam stabilire firmius, septamque omnibus praesidiis tenere catholicam adolescentis aetatis institutionem. Haud sane latet Nos cupidae discendi iuventuti suppetere apud vos publice ludos probe instructos, in quibus certe optimam studiorum rationem non requiras. Sed eniti atque efficere necesse est, ut domicilia litterarum catholica nulla in re concedant ceteris: neque enim est committendum, ut adolescentes nostri minus parati existant a litterarum scientia, ab elegantia doctrinae, quas res fides christiana honestissimas sibi comites ad tutelam et ornamentum exposcit. Postulat igitur religionis amor et patriae caritas, ut quaecumque catholici apte instituta habent vel primordiis litterisque, vel gravioribus disciplinis tradendis, ea constabilienda et augenda pro suis quisque facultatibus curent. — Aequum est autem adiuvari praecipue eruditionem cultumque Cleri, qui non aliter suum hodie locum digne utiliterque tenere potest, quam si omni fere humanitatis et doctrinae laude floruerit. Quo in genere beneficentiae catholicorum studiosissime ad opitulandum proponimus Collegium Blairsense. Opus saluberrimum, magno studio ac liberalitate inchoatum a pientissimi cive, ne patiantur intermissione collabi et interire, sed aemula munificentia in maius etiam provehant, ad fastigiumque celeriter perducant. Tanti enim id est, quanti providere ut ferme in Scotia sacer ordo rite congruenterque temporibus educi possit. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Haec omnia, Venerabiles Fratres, quae propensissimus in Scotos animus Nobis expressit, sic habete ut sollertiae potissimum caritatique vestrae commendata putetis. Porro eam navitatem, quam Nobis luculenter probastis adhuc, probare pergite, ut ista efficiantur quae non parum videntur proposito conducibilia. Perdifficilis sane causa est in manibus, ut professi saepe sumus, humanisque viribus ad expediendum maior; sed longe sanctissima, consiliisque divinae bonitatis apprime congruens. Quare non tam difficultas rei Nos commovet, quam recreat ea cogitatio, vobis ad praescripta Nostra elaborantibus, Dei miserentis opem numquam abfuturam. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">Auspicem caelestium munerum, et paternae Nostrae bene volentiae testem vobis omnibus, Venerabiles Fratres, clero, populoque vestro Apostolicam benedictionem peramanter in Domino impertimus. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><i>Datum Romae apud S.
