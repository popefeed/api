Clinging to Our instructions in the apostolic letter which We gave on July 2, 1894, you have labored to arouse piety in the laity and to revive the old discipline in the clergy. Nor are We ignorant of how great an effort you expended to preserve the safety and rights of the religious societies which have come forth from the old religious communities of your region in order to recall them to their pristine glory. Clerics from Europe are profitably associated with these societies. The noble ardor of these European brothers was not inhibited by the long voyage, nor by the inclemency of the weather, nor by the difference in customs. In addition, many groups founded recently were summoned by your zeal to establish or to govern colleges, to engage in missions, or to perform other functions of the priestly ministry for which the number of your clergy scarcely sufficed. It must be a great consolation to you that your seminaries have increased in number and have been improved.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">2. These happy beginnings and the progress</font> <font size=\"3\">realized up to now inspire Us to hope that the time is not far away when your hierarchy, already enlarged by Us, will respond with greater growth. We base Our hope on your proven zeal and your well-known diligence and on the Brazilian people themselves, who are inclined to piety both by character and by custom.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\"><i>Separate Facilities for Seminarians</i></font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">3. However, there are some things which are so important for the progress of the Catholic religion that it does not suffice to mention them only once; they demand to be recalled and recommended often. Such is the concern for establishing seminaries, to the condition of which the future fortunes of tae Church are intimately joined. Therefore, in setting up their discipline, that which some bishops have already performed should be your highest priority: that the aspirants to the priesthood should live in special houses called \"seminaries\" with their own rules and laws. The houses for young people destined for civil life, can be called episcopal colleges. Experience indicates that mixed seminaries do not respond effectively to the plan and the wisdom of the Church. This common life with the laity is the principal reason clerics abandon their vocation. We should accustom future clerics from an early age to bear</font> <font size=\"3\">the yoke of the Lord, to find time for spiritual exercises, to be devoted to their sacred duties, and to conform themselves to the example of the priestly life. Therefore, they should be protected from dangers, separated from everything worldly, and educated according to the rules set forth by Saint Charles Borromeo just as We see accomplished in the major seminaries of Europe.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">4. In order to avoid dangers, vacations in the country should be provided for these students, but they should not return to their homes. Many bad examples lie in wait for the unwary, especially in settlements where the families of workers are crowded together. Thus, these young men, inclined toward youthful desires, may be either turned away from their undertaking or they, as future priests, may become a stumbling block to the people. We recommend this system to you which has already been tried with good results by several bishops. We ask that you improve the protection of the young clergy in the future by a law commonly agreed upon.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\"><i>Catholic Newspapers</i></font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">5. It is also Our desire, as We have already told you, that effort should be devoted to publishing and distributing Catholic newspapers since at the present time the people form their opinions and draw their moral guidelines from no other source than from the daily reading of such newspapers. It is with regret that We see these weapons cast down among good people since these are drawn from the hands of the impious and lead to the ruin of faith and morals. Therefore, the style of your newspapers should be sharpened and the literary expression aroused so that frivolity may give way to truth and the minds of men may gradually follow the voice of right reason.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\"><i>Catholic Legislators</i></font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">6. Joined to the advantage of the religious press is another advantage, that which results from the access of Catholics to public office and from their admission to the legislative assemblies. For the word is no less powerful than the pen; influence and authority can serve the good cause as well as the written word. It would even be appropriate to send men in holy orders to these legislative assemblies. The rights of the Church would best be defended by these guardians of religion.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">7. But they should beware lest the effort made toward this end be so great that they seem to be motivated more by miserable ambition and blind partisanship than by love of the Catholic cause. What is more undignified than that clerics engage in struggle, and by their administration of the State introduce sedition and discord, the most pernicious things for the State? And what if, following bad counsel, they continually oppose the established authority?</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">8. The only result of such behavior is a great scandal for the people and a source of ill-feeling toward the clergy. Civil power should be exercised with moderation; every suspicion of ambition should be avoided; public offices should be won prudently, and no deviation should be made from true obedience to the supreme authority.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\"><i>Financial Support</i></font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">9. It pleases Us to encourage those arts by which the Christian cause may be promoted among you. May your resources not be less than your good will and may the realization of your excellent plans not be hindered by the lack of money! Contrary to the past, the public treasury no longer provides money for you, for the canons, for the seminaries, for the priests, or for the construction of churches. That leaves you only one resource: the charity of the people. Nonetheless, the custom of the Brazilian people offers great hope in this matter; they are always ready to be generous, especially when this results in obtaining the favors of the Church. We have already praised them in Our letter mentioned above in which We said that We command nothing concerning the endowment of the poorest of the new dioceses; We have confidence in the piety and the faith of the Brazilians that they will not abandon their bishops.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">10. We would place before you as an example the liberality with which the Catholics of North America come to the aid of their numerous bishops, their Catholic colleges, schools, and other religious institutions, but your nation abounds in similar, magnificent examples. We have not forgotten how many splendid churches your ancestors constructed, how many monasteries they endowed, and what great monuments of Christian piety and kindness they left for you.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">11. There are many ways to come to the aid of the Church. The most useful, in Our opinion,</font> <font size=\"3\">is to establish in each diocese a fund to which the faithful can contribute an annual offering collected by men and women selected from the more noble families, under the orders and direction of the priests. These people should also be the principal givers. They will accomplish this best if they give something from their assured income which is often very considerable, and if from their uncertain income they impose on themselves a contribution like a tax.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">12. Another aid, no less important, can be furnished to poor bishops by the monasteries and the pious associations which have a surplus. These associations would contribute more to the common good if they gave the sum of money which some of them are accustomed to spend on public shows to the diocesan fund.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">13. Finally, if the wealthier of the faithful want to follow the laudable custom of their ancestors and to exercise their kindness by making provision in their wills for religious associations or other pious groups, We strongly encourage them to bequeath a portion of their fortune to the bishops so that the bishops, provided with resources, might guard the interests of the Church and their own dignity.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">14. We have promoted your cause, Venerable Brothers. The injustices of the age compel even Us to have recourse to Peter's pence constantly. Take courage in the thought that you can have confidence in God \"because He Himself takes care of Us.\"(1) Keep in mind these words of the Apostle: \"He who provides seed for the sower and bread for the eater will provide in abundance; He will multiply the seed you sow and increase the yield of your righteousness.\"(2)</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">15. May the priests and people at whose head the Holy Spirit placed you as bishops keep before their eyes the liberality of the first Christians who \"were of one heart and one mind\"(3) who, more concerned for the society of the Church than for their own fortune, \"sold their property, brought the price, and placed it at the feet of the apostles.\"(4) May they remember the words of Paul with which We shall conclude: \"We beg you, brothers, respect those among you whose task it is to exercise authority in the Lord and admonish you; esteem them with the greatest love because of their work.\"(5)</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">16. Meanwhile, as a pledge of heavenly blessings and as a sign of Our good will, We affectionately give Our apostolic blessing to you, venerable brothers, to your clergy, and to your people.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\"><i>Given in Rome, at St. Peter's on the eighteenth day of September in the year 1899, the twenty-second year of Our pontificate.</i></font></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><font size=\"3\"><b>LEO XIII</b></font></p>\n<hr>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">REFERENCES:</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">1.1 Pt 5.7.</font> </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">2. 2 Cor 9.10.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">3.

Apostolicis enim Litteris inhaerentes, quas dedimus die II mensis Iulii anno MDCCCXCIV, studio ac labore vestro effecistis ut et excitaretur in populo pietas, et in sacri, ordinis viris vetus disciplina revivisceret. Neque vero Nos latet quantum operae contuleritis ad incolumitatem et iura tuenda religiosorum Sodalium, qui ex antiquis Familiis istius regionis superfuerunt ad eosque in pristinum instituti florem re vocandos; quibus utilissime consociantur alii ex Europa Fratres, quorum nobilem impetum non longitudo itineris, non inclementia caeli, non dissimulimi mores retardarunt. Accedunt recentius institutae Congregationes, eaeque complures, concordi studio vestro accitae, sive condendis aut moderandis ephebeis, sive sacris missionibus obeundis, sive aliis praestandis in sacerdotali munere, ad quae impar numero clerus iste minime sufficeret. Non ultimam denique afferant solatii causam Seminaria apud vos vel aucta numero vel in melius restituta. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">Fausta haec initia et habiti huc usque progressus spem iniiciunt brevi fore, ut amplificatae per Nos istic sacrae Hierarchiae maiora in dies incrementa respondeant. Quod quidem quum probata industria ac perspecta diligentia vestra, Venerabiles Fratres, tum etiam prona ad pietatem et indole et consuetudine Brasilianorum gens satis polliceri videntur. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">Sunt quaedam tamen ad rei catholicae profectum ita necessaria, ut ea semel attigisse non satis sit; commemorari saepius et commendari velint. Huc potissimum pertinet cura in Seminariis collocanda, quorum cum statu fortuna Ecclesiae coniungitur maxime. In eorum igitur disciplina instauranda illud in primis cordi est, quod nonnulli sacrorum antistites iam feliciter praestiterunt, ut separatis aedibus, suisque seorsim institutis ac legibus, degant alumni, qui spem afferant sese Deo mancipandi per sacros ordines, eorumque domus retineant Seminarii nomen; aliae, instituendis ad civilia munia adolescentibus, Convictus vel Collegia episcopalia nuncupentur. Quotidiano enim usu constat, mixta Seminaria Ecclesiae consilio ac providentiae minus respondere; ea contubernia cum laicis causam esse quamobrem clerici plerumque a sancto proposito dimoveantur. Hos decet vel a prima aetate iugo Domini assuescere, pietati vacare plurimum, in servire sacris ministeriis, vitae sacerdotalis exemplo conformari. Arcendi ergo mature a periculis, seiungendi a profanis, instituendi iuxta propositas a sancto Carolo Borromeo leges saluberrimas, quemadmodum in Europae Seminariis praecipuis fieri videmus. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">Eadem vitandi periculi ratio suadet ut comparetur alumnis rusticatio ad feriandum, nec arbitrium relinquatur suae cuique ipsorum adeundae familiae. Multa enim pravitatis exempla manent incautos, praesertim in colonicis iis domibus, ubi operariorum familiae glomerantur; quo fit ut, in iuveniles cupiditates proni, aut ab incoepto deterreamur, aut sacerdotes futuri sint offensioni populo. Rem istic iam tentatam feliciter a quibusdam Episcopis maxime commendamus, auctoresque sumus vobis, Venerabiles Fratres, ut facta communiter eiusmodi lege adolescentis cleri tutelae melius in posterum prospiciatis. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">Nec minus in votis est, quod alias significavimus, ut scribendis vulgandisque catholicis diariis naviter eaque ac prudenter impendatur opera. Vix enim, quae nostra aetas est, aliunde haurit vulgus opiniones sibique fingit mores, quam ex quotidianis hisce lectionibus. Interim aegre est iacere arma haec apud bonos, quae impiorum manibus tractata lenocinio callidissimo, miserrimum fidei et moribus exitium parant. Acuendus igitur stilus est excitandaeque litterae, ut veritati vanitas cedat et incorruptae voci rationis atque iustitiae sensim obsequantur praeiudicatae mentes. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">Huic utilitati finitima est alia, quae ex accessione catholicorum hominum ad rempublicam eorumque cooptatione in coetum oratorum legibus ferendis derivatur. Neque enim voce minus quam scripto, neque gratia et auctoritate minus quam litteris optimae quaeque causae iuvari possunt. Adscisci etiam aliquando in eos coetus sacri ordinis viros haud inopportunum videtur; quin etiam iis praesidiis et quasi Religionis excubiis optime licet Ecclesiae iura tueri. Verum illud cavendum maxime, ne ad haec fiat tanta contentio, ut misera ambitione magis aut partium caeco studio, quam rei catholicae cura impelli videantur. Quid enim indignius, quam digladiari sacros ministros ut ex procuratione reipublicae rem perniciosissimam in civitatem inducant, seditionem atque discordiam? Quid vero si in deteriorum consilia ruentes constitutae auctoritati perpetuo adversentur? Quae omnia mirum quantum offensionis habent in populo et quantum invidiae conflant in clerum. Modeste igitur utendum iure suffragii; vitanda omnis suspicio amotionis, reipublicae munia capessenda prudenter ; a supremae vero auctoritatis obsequio desciscendum nunquam. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">Placuit iterum, Venerabiles Fratres, hortatores esse ad eas artes, quibus christianae rei bono apud vos opportune consulatur. Atque utinam egregiae voluntati vestrae non essent impares vires, nec optimis consiliis in usum deducendis impedimento esset angustia pecuniae. Neque enim, ut antea, ex publico aerario suppeditantur sumptus aut Vobis, aut Canonicorum Collegiis, aut Seminariis, aut Curionibus, aut aedificationi templorum. Una paene restat, cui liceat inniti, gratiflcandi popularis voluntas. Nihilominus hac in re spem affert eximiam Brasilianae gentis consuetudo, ex animi sui nobilitate, in largitiones paratissima, praesertim in iis quae pertinent ad bene de Ecclesia merendum. Atque hanc scilicet ipsorum laudem Litteris Nostris superius memoratis exornavimus, quum de dote constituenda novis dioecesibus, quae opis indigent maxime, nihil habere Nos diximus quod praeciperemus; in Brasiliani populi pietate ac religione satis Nobis esse fiduciae, ipsum episcopis non defuturam. Ac libenter quidem in exemplum proponeremus effusam benignitatem, qua septentrionalis Americae filii suis episcopis, longe numero pluribus, itemque catholicis collegiis, scholis, ceterisque piis institutis certa tim occurrunt, nisi vestra natio domesticis exemplis iisque splendidissimis abundaret. Memoria ne excidat quot conspicua templa maiores vestri extruenda curaverint, quot monasteriis dotem constituerint, quam grandia christianae pietatis ac beneficentiae vobis monumenta reliquerint. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">Opitulandi autem Ecclesiae necessitatibus modi suppetunt plures. In his perutile ducimus ut sua in quaque dioecesi constituatur arca, quo annuam conferant stipem fideles, ab delectis e coetu nobiliore viris ac feminis colligendam, nutu et ductu Curionum. Decet autem horum primas esse in largiendo partes; quod optime efficient, si ex certis redditibus, quibus ipsi fruuntur saepe lautissimis, aliquid cedant, et super incertos proventus vim aliquam pecuniae sibi solvendam imponant, instar vectigalis. — Nec minus auxilio esse possunt episcopis inopia laborantibus monasteria illa piaeque sodalitates, quibus amplior est res; Tectisque publico bono fuerit consultum si arcae dioecesanae destinetur haud exigua illa pecuniae summa, quae in profana spectacula solet a quibusdam ex memoratis sodalitatibus coniici. — Si qui denique, fortunae bonis prae ceteris affluentes, maiorem sectari morem laudabilem velint ac testamento cavere sive piis sodalitatibus sive coetibus aliis exercendae beneficentiae gratia, eos vehementer hortamur ut pecuniae summam aliquam meminerint legare episcopis, qua hi relevati et res Ecclesiae et dignitatem suam tueri valeant. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">Vestram egimus causam, Venerabiles Fratres, Nos ipsi, quos temporum iniuria cogit Petri stipem rogare constantius. Ceterum vos primum erigat cogitatio fiduciae in Deo collocandae, <i>quoniam ipsi cura est de nobis</i> (I Petr. V, 7); animoque subeant Apostoli verba: <i>qui autem administrat semen seminanti, et panem ad mandueandum praestabit, et multiplicabit semen vestrum, et augebit incrementa frugum iustitiae vestrae</i> (II Cor. IX, 10). Clerus vero ac populus, quibus regendis Spiritus Sanctus vos posuit episcopos, sibi oculis proponant pristinam illam credentium liberalitatem, quorum multitudinis <i>erat cor unum et anima una </i>(Act. IV, 32); qui de sancta Ecclesiae societate multo magis quam suis de fortunis solliciti, vendentes afferebant pretia eorum quae <i>vendebant, et ponebant ante pedes Apostolorum</i> (Act. IV, 34-35). Meminerint Pauli verba, quibus eos ad ultimum compellamus: <i>Rogamus autem vos, fratres, ut noveritis eos, qui laborant inter vos, et praesunt vobis in Domino, et monent vos, ut habeatis illos abundantius in charitate propter opus illorum</i> (I Thess. V, 12-13). </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><font size=\"3\">Interea, caelestium munerum auspicem ac benevolentiae Nostrae testem, Vobis, Venerabiles Fratres, Clero populoque vestro Apostolicam benedictionem peramanter in Domino impertimus. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><i><font size=\"3\">Datum Romae apud S.
