By your firm commitment and your unwavering support of this Catholic institution of higher learning, you make a significant contribution to the future of the Church and of society. Therefore I greet you and thank you in the name of the Church. </p> <p align=\"left\"> You are aware of the great need in modern society for a new evangelization; you know of the profound benefits that the Gospel message can bring when it truly permeates and informs patterns of thought, standards of judgment and norms of behavior. Accordingly, as active proponents of Catholic education you understand the importance of the Church’s mission in this regard, and you see the unique possibilities afforded by the academic community for serving the Church in the fulfilment of this mission. </p> <p align=\"left\"> The Catholic University of America offers an authentic service in enriching American culture and society. Your efforts therefore as Trustees of the University truly serve the common good. </p> <p align=\"left\"> I likewise extend a special word of appreciation to the <i>University Orchestra </i>and to the <i>Chorus of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception</i> in Washington. I thank you for your presence here today and for your praise of God through music and song. May the Lord fill you with joy as you help to raise the hearts of others through your art. </p> <p align=\"left\"> To all of you I impart my Apostolic Blessing, asking God to confirm and deepen your faith, hope and love. </p> <p align=\"center\">  </p> <p align=\"center\"> <font color=\"#663300\" size=\"3\">© Copyright 1993</font><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"><font color=\"#663300\" size=\"3\"> - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></font></p> </font>\n<p> </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
