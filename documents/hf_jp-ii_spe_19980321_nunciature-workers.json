Cappa construction company, and all who have worked so hard to complete part of this Nunciature building in time for my Visit. The Nunciature in Lagos had served well for thirty-five years, but as we approach the Third Millennium the time has now come to move to Abuja, the new Capital City of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Abuja is itself a symbol of growth and hope for the future, and offers a more central location for the Apostolic Nunciature in this country."

Cappa construction company, and all who have worked so hard to complete part of this Nunciature building in time for my Visit. The Nunciature in Lagos had served well for thirty-five years, but as we approach the Third Millennium the time has now come to move to Abuja, the new Capital City of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Abuja is itself a symbol of growth and hope for the future, and offers a more central location for the Apostolic Nunciature in this country.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The Catholic Church is still relatively young in Nigeria, but she is full of vitality and enthusiasm, and she looks to the future with confidence and optimism. Her mission of loving service to the men and women of this nation, inspired by the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, will benefit greatly from this new Apostolic Nunciature, which is a visible link with the See of Peter and a sign of the unity of the Church.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">In expressing my gratitude to all who have made possible the construction of this Nunciature, I pray that the Lord will reward everyone for their dedication and for the many sacrifices involved. May the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Nigeria, watch over all who will live and work here.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">To all of you here present, and to your families and loved ones, I cordially impart my Apostolic Blessing.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"> </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
