Your association seeks to promote the active involvement of individuals and groups in the life of the community, especially through charitable activities and programs aimed at responding to the social, educational and cultural needs of your neighbors. I would encourage you in all of this, since initiatives of this sort foster solidarity between different social groups, concern for the poor and disadvantaged, and responsibility for the future of society. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> The Church’s activity in the various fields of social service is ultimately inspired by her conviction that \"the person and society need not only material goods but spiritual and religious values as well\" (John Paul II, <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/edocs/ENG0214/__P8.HTM\"><i>Centesimus Annus</i>, 61</a>). All who are committed to building a society worthy of man are challenged to recognize the ethical dimensions of their decisions, and to work together in facing social issues with attention to their moral implications for the welfare of coming generations. May your own involvement in the life of your community always be guided by a deep concern to encourage the full development of each individual and of the whole community. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> Upon all of you and your families I willingly invoke God’s abundant blessings. </p>\n<p align=\"center\">  </p>\n<p align=\"center\"> <font color=\"#663300\" size=\"3\">© Copyright 1992 - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\">  </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
