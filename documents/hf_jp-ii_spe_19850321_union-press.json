The good news of what the saints had done through the power of Jesus led him to ask himself why he could not do the same in the name of Jesus—ad maiorem Dei gloriam for the greater glory of God.</p>\n<p>Lives can be changed by the written word ; individuals can be converted to Christ or to ever greater union with him through knowing how he is imitated in the lives of others.</p>\n<p>Contemporary journalism often seeks out the hidden sinners in society, so that their crimes may be revealed and so that society may be healed. This service can indeed be salutary. But I would also hope that contemporary Catholic journalism, in particular, might seek out the hidden saints—those humble men and women who teach the young, who care for the sick, who counsel the troubled—those hidden servants of God who truly live the Gospel. In their lives they praise Jesus Christ; a greater knowledge of their hidden, humble and heroic work could well lead others to praise Jesus Christ. In a world sο often divided by conflict and by hatred and sο often marred by sin and self­ishness, self-sacrifice and service of others in the name of Jesus are truly newsworthy ; they are facets of the good news of Christ which it is our privilege not only to proclaim but also to seek out and to make known so that others may be encouraged, inspired αηd even converted to faith or to fervour.</p>\n<p>This is one small way in which we can give praise to Jesus Christ in the work of Catholic journalism, and we can take solace in the fact that the words we write remain. Scripta manent. When images pass from sight and when spoken words pass from memory, the good news about Christ's Church and about Christians which we have the privi-lege to record can lead to meditation, to reflection and to enduring praise of Jesus Christ, our Lord and God. In our words and in our work, praised be Jesus Christ, for ever and ever !</p>\n<p align=\"left\">  </p>\n<p align=\"center\">  </p>\n<p align=\"center\"> <font color=\"#663300\" size=\"3\">© Copyright 1985 - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<p align=\"center\">  </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
