For the personal sacrifices of the Members and advisors of the Committee and for their prayerful and faith-filled commitment to their labors I express my sincere thanks.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">To this gratitude I add the hope that the translation into English of the latest edition of the <i>Missale Romanum</i> may soon be completed, so that the faithful throughout the English-speaking world may benefit from the use of liturgical texts accurately rendered in accordance with the norms of the Instruction <i>Liturgiam Authenticam.</i> Trusting in the assistance of the Holy Spirit in this great ecclesial enterprise, and invoking the intercession of Mary, Mother of the Church, I gladly impart my Apostolic Blessing to you and to all those involved in this important work.</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><i>From the Vatican, 9 November 2005.</i> </p>\n<p align=\"center\"><b>BENEDICTUS PP.
