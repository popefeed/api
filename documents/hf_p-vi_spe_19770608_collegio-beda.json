        "en": "And nowa greeting to the priests from the Pontifical Beda College. As you prepare to return to your dioceses, we want you to know that you will always have a special place in the heart of the Pope. Christ himself has called you, and now the Church sends you out to proclaim the fullness of the Catholic faith, in all its purity, in all its exigencies, in all its power. And remember to show the people, by word and example, that you really do believe in the affirmation of Saint Paul: “For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake” (Cor. 4, 5). Yes, dear sons, the Pope urges you to preach only the Lord Jesus Christ. And may the Lord Jesus be the joy and strength of your lives."
