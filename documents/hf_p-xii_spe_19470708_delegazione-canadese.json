We repeat that hope today. </p>\n<p>Our very sincere welcome to you, who also have wished to come here before returning to your country, is the more pleasant for Us, because it gives a happy occasion to send Our affectionate greetings to Canada and cordial good wishes for its prosperity. Only a few weeks ago We had the joy of ad-dressing a large and distinguished gathering in the Dominion's Capital, come together to make public profession of their reverence and love for the Immaculate Mother of God. A most salutary memory to awaken and stimulate in these sad days, when physical wretchedness undermines Christian morality, and shameless proposals made by irresponsible persons, heedless of God's law and reckless of the irreparable harm that would ensue to domestic and civil society, aim at its utter collapse. The world will never be bettered through moral degradation. </p>\n<p>May Canada preserve intact the glory of her Christian heritage through a self-disciplined reverence for what is holy, just and honourable. The world will be thus her eternal debtor. As a pledge of heavenly graces We invoke on you and your dear ones God's blessing. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>*Discorsi e Radiomessaggi di Sua Santità Pio XII</i>, IX, <br/> Nono anno di Pontificato, 2 marzo 1947- 1° marzo 1948, p. 163<br/> Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></hr></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
