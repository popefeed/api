        "en": "You come from a land where, one hears, public opinion wields no inconsiderable power. That can be a healthy sign for any nation, where there is an enlightened public opinion.; but the problem is to make sure that public opinionis enlightened, is formed and formulated in the light of truth and justice and, let Us add, Christian charity. How much this opinion owes to the press and, today especially, to the radio and television, you gentlmen, need not be told; but it is always timely to reflect on the consequent, heavy responsibility to the community that rests on all members of your profession. Normally in matters of moment, truth is not so hidden, that a sincere and careful search will not discover it. And yet, even when it is written in letters so large and clear that he who runs can read it, how often is it distorted beyond recognition or suppressed for unworthy motives. From this practice come dissension among citizens, embittered strife and rancour. Public opinion fed on error and calumny can only poison the body politic. Hence it is always gratifying to meet with editors and journalists who are sincerely seeking to get the facts and with unbiassed judgement to present the truth to their readers. The Psalmist offers a motto for the press : « ever let thy truth guide and teach me, O God » (24, 5). We are happy to pray God's blessing on your work and on all near and dear to you."
