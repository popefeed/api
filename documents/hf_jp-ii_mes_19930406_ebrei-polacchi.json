We remember, and we need to remember, but we need to remember with renewed trust in God and in his all–healing blessing. </p> <p>In their Pastoral Letter of 30 November 1990, the Polish Bishops wrote about what took place in Poland then, but also about the present–day responsibility of Christians and Jews: \"the mutual loss of life, a sea of terrible suffering and of wrongs endured should not divide but unite us. The places of execution, and in many cases, the common graves, call for this unity\". </p> <p>As Christians and Jews, following the example of the faith of Abraham, we are called to be a blessing for the world (Cf. <i>Gen</i> 12: 2ss.). This is the common task awaiting us. It is therefore necessary for us, Christians and Jews, to be first a blessing to one another. This will effectively occur if we are united in the face of the evils which are still threatening: indifference and prejudice, as well as displays of anti–Semitism. </p> <p>For what has already been achieved by Catholics and Jews through dialogue and cooperation I give thanks with you to God; for what we are still called to do I offer my ardent prayers. May God further guide us along the paths of his sovereign and loving will for the human family. </p> <p><i>From the Vatican, 6 April 1993. </i> </p> <p> <br/> </p> <p align=\"center\"><b>IOANNES PAULUS PP. II </b> </p></font><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
