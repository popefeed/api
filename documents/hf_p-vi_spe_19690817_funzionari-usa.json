We are constantly aware of the assistance your country is giving to other lands struggling to develop their resources. Indeed, few countries can have had similar weight in deciding the fortunes of the whole human race. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> Because of this importance, We ask you to encourage your fellow citizens to use their nation’s power and influence wisely and generously, with a view to the true welfare of all men. We pray that they may be inspired by such noble idealism, and We invoke upon you, on your dear ones, and on your country, God’s richest blessings.<font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\"> </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\">  </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
