We pray that abundant heavenly graces may be with them in their increased responsibilities, and that the government of their people may be blessed with peace and justice. We give assurance that the Church will continue to help and cooperate in its beneficial mission of spiritual and social assistance. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> We ask you also, Venerable Brother, to convey to the clergy and faithful Our special fatherly greetings, so that at this historic point in the history of their Island they may have a pledge of Our continued paternal regard, and invoking divine guidance and abundant heavenly graces, We lovingly impart to you, and to all Our beloved children of the Island who are celebrating their Statehood Day, Our paternal Apostolic Blessing. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <i>From the Vatican, October 27, 1969. </i> </p>\n<p align=\"center\"> <b>PAULUS PP.
