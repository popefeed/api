        "en": "We extend a warm welcome to a group of students from the Catholic University of Tokyo. Your University is named«Sophia», that is, wisdom, and we are confident that the pursuit of wisdom is an important goal of your life. Certainly you have come to know the centuries-old wisdom of your people, and your visit to Europe will have helped you to understand and share some of the wisdom of other peoples as well. We hope that you will remain faithful to the noble ideals and principles of the generations that have gone before you. But is also your task as young people to transform this wisdom into action that will meet the problems of our times. We assure you of our prayers and we invoke upon you abundant blessings from Almighty God."
