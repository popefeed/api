The Eskimos and Indians of the far north, the homeless of Africa and of Asia, the Aborigines of Australia, the victims of wars-to these and many others the Fund Association offers solace and succour for their children. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> Such work to help the needy and distressed is very dear to Us, and We know how much Our illustrious Predecessors, especially Pope Benedict XV, held in esteem the “Save the Children Fund”. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> Throughout the world We see and feel the sufferings and urgent necessities of countless innocent victims of human degradation and tragedy, and We readily extend the hand of friendship to your Association, which is able to assist effectively so many of these helpless children. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> In the Jubilee Service We join in spirit, praying for the work of your Association and for the children who so urgently claim its aid. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> We give assurance of Our continued interest and cordially offer Our good wishes to all associated in any way with the “Save the Children Fund”, invoking abundant divine blessings. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <i>From the Vatican, April 30, 1969. </i> </p>\n<p align=\"center\"> <b>PAULUS PP.
