Yes, brethren, with the Apostle Peter we proclaim that “there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved” (<i>Act. </i>4, 12).</p>\n<p>On her part the Catholic Church is solemnly committed by the Second Vatican Council to an ecumenism based on increased fidelity to Christ the Lord and on conversion of heart (Cfr. <i> <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html\"> Unitatis Redintegratio</a>, </i>6-7).2 At the same time she realizes that “nothing is so foreign to ecumenism as a false conciliatory approach” (<i>Unitatis Redintegratio</i>, 11).</p>\n<p>Strengthened by the power of God’s word, let us then, despite all obstacles pursue the goal of full unity in Christ and in the Church.</p>\n<p>And in humility and love let us turn our thoughts and hopes to our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom, together with his Father and the Holy Spirit, be glory for ever and ever.</p>\n<p><font face=\"Times\">                             </font></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
