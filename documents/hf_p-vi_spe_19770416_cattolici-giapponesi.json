We know that your organization was founded in the spirit and vitality of the Second Vatican Council by the late Cardinal Doi, whose memory we evoke today with reverence and honour.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">And we are pleased to express our gratification for the aim that you pursue: to assist those who are abandoned, lonely and sick. This purpose is indeed worthy of the higest Christian zeal and recalls the words of the Lord Jesus: “. . . as long as you did it for one of these, the least of my brethren, you did it for me” (<i>Matth. </i>25, 40). These words are indeed normative for all Christians and your desire to live them to the full renders honour to the Church in Japan and is a manifestation of authentic Christian concern.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">May the Lord assist you to persevere in good works for the glory of your Father in heaven. With paternal affection in Christ Jesus we impart to you our Apostolic Blessing.</p>\n<p>                                <font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\">  </font></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
