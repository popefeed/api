To those who live in highly industrialized communities they may seem to be matters of little importance, but we are well aware that the lack of the means to draw from the earth i:s full fruitfulness can mean real disaster to those places whose economy is based upon agriculture. Here we cannot but think of the developing countries, the well-being of which must be our constant concern and the object of our practical solicitude. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\"> For our part, we express the fervent hope that your efforts will ever be directed towards working to redress, as far as is in your power, the grievous imbalance between the living standards of the rich and of the poor regions of this world. Indeed one may say that upon your efforts in this sphere depends to a large degree the very survival of whole sections of the human family. </font> </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\"> As we assure you of our good wishes, we pray that Almighty God will further your efforts and make you effective instruments for ensuring the prosperity of the greatest possible number of our brothers and sisters. By being thus assisted in their pressing needs, they will be able more easily to raise their hearts to the higher and eternal destiny offered to them by the Lord, in whom all of us \"live and move and have our being\" (<i>Act</i>. 17, 28).</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <font face=\"Times\">                                          </font> <font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\">  </font></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
