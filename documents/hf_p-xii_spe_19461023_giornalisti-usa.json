To particularize is not necessary; for the vision is vividly present to you. The clash of arms has long since ceased; but for tens of thousands the ravages of war are still most actual. There is an immense need of material reorganization, but there is still greater need of spiritual rehabilitation; and one can with difficulty be achieved without the other. It is imperative that men be brought to a renewed appreciation of those eternal verities which, while they fully warrant the hope of future recompense for sufferings rightly borne, give courage to endure present misfortunes. </p>\n<p>Your profession affords you the unique opportunity of sharing in this twofold reconstruction; because it is for you not merely to inform your readers of what you have seen, but also to stimulate right thinking by the just interpretation of what you have observed. </p>\n<p>Our wish and Our prayer shall be that the Father of mercies and the God of Truth may prosper your efforts in this noble and challenging field, and bless you and all those dear to you most abundantly.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><i>*Discorsi e Radiomessaggi di Sua Santità Pio XII</i>, VIII, <br/> Ottavo anno di Pontificato, 2 marzo 1946 - 1° marzo 1947, p. 275<font face=\"Times New Roman\"><br/> Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana</font></p>\n<p> </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></hr></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
