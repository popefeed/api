You are well aware of how much the Church prizes endeavours such as the one in which you are engaged. Recent years have seen a great expansion in the content and method of the theological sciences. You are to be praised for the interest in theological renewal which has brought you to Rome in order to draw upon the rich resources found here. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">You know that questions concerning religion continue to be asked, even by the most highly educated. Thus theological renewal offers important pastoral assistance, for it enables the priest to speak with broader learning and surer knowledge. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">As you return to your homeland, we are confident that you will remember always what is the most important thing: it is your life with Jesus. May he enrich your prayer with his joy and peace; may he deepen your study with his wisdom and understanding; may he render your work more effective with the power of his love and grace. For this purpose we gladly impart to you our special Apostolic Blessing.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">                              </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
