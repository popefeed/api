But, as your spokesman has said, Christians look to this city also as to their religious capital, in spite of their sad disagreements and misunderstandings. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> We take pleasure in noting that your visit to Us is on the eve of the celebration of the two great apostles who laid the foundations of the Church of Christ at Rome. In your studies you will see how their heritage has left a deep imprint on the Eternal City, penetrating its history, inspiring its art, and shaping its culture. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> May your stay in Rome enrich your minds and your spirits. And, while repeating how moved We are at this visit which you have paid Us, We invoke on you, on your families, your studies, your university and your’ country, God’s blessings in rich abundance.<font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\"> </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\">  </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
