Your distinguished delegation has come to the Holy See in a spirit of religious understanding and exchange, and it is with honour and friendship that we welcome you today.</p>\n<p>Your presence here recalls our own visit to Indonesia and our cordial contacts with the authorities of your land. On that solemn occasion in Jakarta-seven years ago this week-we had the opportunity to express our sincere esteem for all your people, and our respect for the stable principles from which your country takes its inspiration, and on which the fabric of its civil life is based. Above all we render homage to the primacy of belief in God Almighty.</p>\n<p>Today me pray that abiding religious and social tranquillity will be the lot of all your people and the lasting honour of Indonesian society. And may mutual understanding and assistance, as well as friendship and brotherhood under God, be the treasured legacy of Indonesia.</p>\n<p><font face=\"Times\">                </font></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
