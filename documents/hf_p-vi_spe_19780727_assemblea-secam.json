        "en": "The Holy Fatherasks you to communicate to the members of SECAM gathered in Nairobi that he is spiritually close to them as they prayerfully discuss the great theme of Christian Family Life in the context of Africa today. His Holiness invokes upon the assembled bishops the assistance of the Holy Spirit so that with pastoral sensitivity inspired by supernatural wisdom and in the communion of the universal Church they may lead their beloved people to an ever greater appreciation of the full teaching of Christ and his Church on the sacrament of Matrimony. He is convinced that every pastoral effort to proclaim clearly the holiness of Christian marriage as an expression of the faithful and permanent love of Christ for his Church is a contribution of immense value to the future of Africa. In the love of the Saviour the Holy Father sends to all the bishops his special Apostolic Blessing which he extends to all the clergy religious and laity whom they serve in Christ."
