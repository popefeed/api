As religious representatives of your people, you have demonstrated to others that religion does play an important role in Japan. Unless men believe in God and recognize that the human family is one under one God, respect and understanding, as well as brotherly cooperation, will be lacking. Visits such as yours are precious because by them people get to know one another to the mutual benefit of all. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> We ask you to take our most cordial greetings to your people in Japan, and to assure them that We have a great affection for them. We pray Almighty God to bless your land with prosperity, happiness and peace.<font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\"> </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <font face=\"Times\"> </font></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
