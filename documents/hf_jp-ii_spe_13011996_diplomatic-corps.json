I thank you for your presence and for the good wishes formulated by your Dean with such refinement of sentiment and expression. Please accept in return my own fervent wish that God will bless you, your families and your nations; may he grant to everyone a year of happiness!</p>\n<p>It is with joy that each year I see an increase in the number of countries which maintain diplomatic relations with the Holy See. Today there are more than a hundred and sixty. Such a development seems to us to show the genuine esteem which many have for the Apostolic See and its mission among the nations. This constitutes, for the Pope and those who assist him, a constant reminder to cooperate ever more intensely with the greatest number of people and organizations who, out of respect for morality and law, endeavour to ensure that justice and peace reign on our earth. I wish to say how much I appreciate the words of Ambassador Joseph Amichia, who in your name has kindly emphasized some of the initiatives thanks to which the Pope and, with him, the Holy See have given voice to all those people throughout the world who ardently yearn for peace, tranquillity and solidarity.</p>\n<p>2. Today we cannot but rejoice to see here, for the first time, the Representative of the Palestinian People. For more than a year, as you know, the Holy See has enjoyed diplomatic relations with the State of Israel. We had been looking forward to this happy state of affairs, because it is the eloquent sign that the Middle East has resolutely taken the path of peace proclaimed to mankind by the Child born in Bethlehem. May God assist the Israelis and Palestinians to live from now on side by side, with one another, in peace, mutual esteem and sincere cooperation! Future generations demand this and the whole region will benefit from it.</p>\n<p>But allow me to confide that this hope could prove ephemeral if a just and adequate solution is not also found to the particular problem of Jerusalem. The religious and universal dimension of the Holy City demands a commitment on the part of the whole international community, in order to ensure that the City preserves its uniqueness and retains its living character. The Holy Places, dear to the three monotheistic religions, are of course important for believers, but they would lose much of their significance if they were not permanently surrounded by active communities of Jews, Christians and Muslims, enjoying true freedom of conscience and religion, and developing their own religious, educational and social activities. The year 1996 should see the beginning of negotiations on the definitive status of the territories under the administration of the National Palestinian Authority, and also on the sensitive issue of the City of Jerusalem. It is my hope that the international community will offer the political partners most directly involved the juridical and diplomatic instruments capable of ensuring that Jerusalem, one and holy, may truly be a \"crossroads of peace\".</p>\n<p>This serene and resolute quest for peace and brotherhood will contribute without any doubt to providing other still existing regional problems with solutions which will respond to the aspirations of peoples still worried about their fate and their future. I am thinking especially of Lebanon, whose sovereignty is still threatened, and of Iraq, whose peoples are still waiting for the chance to lead a normal life, safe from all arbitrary action.</p>\n<p>3. A climate of peace also seems to be advancing in certain parts of Europe. Bosnia-Hercegovina has been able to benefit from an agreement which should - we hope - safeguard its territorial integrity while taking into account its ethnic composition. Sarajevo especially, another city of symbolic significance, should likewise become a crossroads of peace. Is it not in fact called the \"Jerusalem of Europe\"? If the outbreak of the First World War is linked to this city, from now on its name ought to be synonymous with a city of peace, and cultural, social and religious meetings and exchanges ought to foster its multi-ethnic harmony. This involves a process which will be long and is not without difficulties. In this regard I would like to point out that an enduring peace in the Balkans can only be achieved if certain conditions are met: the free flow of people and ideas; the unhindered return of refugees to their homes; the preparation of truly democratic elections; and finally, sustained material and moral reconstruction, in which not only the international community but also the Churches and Religious Communities are called to take part unreservedly. Although this war, which I have often described as \"useless\", seems to be over, the work of building and consolidating peace looms as a great challenge in the first place to Europeans - but not only to them, - to ensure that indifference or selfishness do not reach the point of causing the shipwreck of a whole region of Europe, with unforeseeable consequences.</p>\n<p>Northern Ireland also continues to move towards a more serene future and the peace process offers hope of a stable and permanent peace. From now on all are called upon to banish for ever two evils which are in no way inevitable: sectarian extremism and political violence. May the Catholics and Protestants of that region respect one another, build peace together, and cooperate in everyday life!</p>\n<p>Among the encouraging signs, I cannot fail to mention the political evolution of South America, where the majority of the people are Catholics, and whose spiritual vitality is a treasure for the Church. Numerous elections have taken place in recent months and have been conducted in conditions which international observers have judged to be normal. But social inequalities are still very marked, and the problem of the production of drugs and drug-trafficking remains unsolved. These are factors which ought to spur political and economic leaders of that Continent to manage public affairs and the economy in a way which is ever more attentive to the aspirations and real needs of the people. This kind of approach, let us not forget, has enabled the peace process in Central America to go forward. In Nicaragua and El Salvador arms have fallen silent. In Guatemala reconciliation is going well. To be sure, the end of hostilities does not always mean social peace. Demilitarization is difficult to impose, and respect for human rights is not absolute. But there too a new climate is gradually emerging. For her part, the Catholic Church does not fail to contribute to this process.</p>\n<p>This new climate, offering hope, which is developing thanks to the strenuous work of courageous negotiators to whom gratitude is due, must not only be a truce. Between threatening forms of extremism, peace must become a reality. And if this is achieved, it will be contagious.</p>\n<p>4. But there are still too many hotbeds of conflict, more or less disguised, which keep people under the unbearable yoke of violence, hatred, uncertainty and death.</p>\n<p>I am thinking of course of Algeria, very near to us, where blood is spilled almost daily: we cannot but ardently hope to see established at last, in a just respect for differences, a reasonable settlement and a national plan in which everyone can be considered a partner.</p>\n<p>Still in the Mediterranean region, I would like to mention an island which has been divided since 1974: Cyprus. No solution has yet been found. Such a situation, which prevents people who are separated or dispossessed of their property from building their future, cannot be maintained indefinitely. May the negotiations between the parties involved be intensified and inspired by a sincere desire to bring them to a successful conclusion!</p>\n<p>Cooperation in the Mediterranean is an indispensable factor for European stability and security, as was stated by those taking part in the recent European Summit in Barcelona. In this context, we must not overlook questions of identity, territory and neighbours, as well as of religion: these are all elements to be reconciled in order to make this Mediterranean zone an area of cultural, religious and economic cooperation which could benefit all the peoples of the countries bordering it.</p>\n<p>5. If we look towards the East, we must again note, unfortunately, that fighting is continuing in Chechnya. Afghanistan is still in a political stalemate, with the people being treated without respect and plunged into the greatest distress. In Kashmir and Sri Lanka fighting has continued to take its toll among the civilian populations. The people of East Timor too are still waiting for proposals capable of allowing the realization of their legitimate aspirations to see their special cultural and religious identity recognized.</p>\n<p>We must admire and support the courage of the many men and women who manage to safeguard the identity of their peoples and who hand on to the younger generations the torch of memory and hope.</p>\n<p>6. Turning to Africa, we are compelled to deplore the continuing presence of hotbeds of war and ethnic conflicts which constitute a permanent handicap for the Continent's development. The situation in Liberia and in Somalia, to which international assistance has not succeeded in bringing peace, is still governed by the law of violence and of special interests. Widespread armed activity has also plunged Sierra Leone into a situation of tension and increased insecurity. The Southern Sudan remains a region where dialogue and negotiation are not welcomed. We would also like to see more decisive progress in Angola, where political antagonisms and social disintegration prevent normalization. Rwanda and Burundi are still affected by a wave of ethnic and nationalist rivalry, the tragic consequences of which the people have already experienced in the extreme. </p>\n<p>Last year, on this same occasion, I had asked for more international solidarity for Africa, and in the present circumstances I cannot but earnestly renew this appeal. But today I would like to direct my comments most particularly to the consciences of Africa's political leaders: if you do not commit yourselves more resolutely to national democratic dialogue, if you do not more clearly respect human rights, if you do not strictly administer public funds and external credits, if you do not condemn ethnic ideology, the African Continent will ever remain on the margin of the community of nations. In order to be helped, African governments must be politically credible. The Bishops of Africa, meeting in the Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, underlined the urgent need for the competent management of public affairs and the proper training of political leaders - men and women - who \"profoundly love their own people and wish to serve rather than be served\" (Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Ecclesia in Africa, 111).</p>\n<p>7. These situations of conflict which I have just mentioned briefly are not inevitable. The positive developments which certain regions have experienced, regions themselves caught up in the meshes of violence, show that it is possible to restore trust in others, which is really trust in life. A guaranteed and courageously safeguarded peace is a victory over the ever lurking forces of death.</p>\n<p>In this spirit, I cannot but encourage the work which will resume in Geneva in a few days, of the Conference on revising the Convention on conventional arms which are the cause of so much suffering, and the conclusion, during 1996, of the treaty on the banning of nuclear tests. In this regard, the Holy See is of the opinion that, in the sphere of nuclear weapons, the banning of tests and of the further development of these weapons, disarmament and non-proliferation are closely linked and must be achieved as quickly as possible under effective international controls. These are steps towards a general and total disarmament which the international community as a whole should accomplish without delay.</p>\n<p>8. As I have had occasion to recall several times, what the International Community brings together is not just States but Nations, made up of men and women who weave a personal and collective history. It is their rights which must be defined and guaranteed. But, as happens in the family, these rights have to be qualified on the basis of the importance of corresponding duties. On the occasion of my recent visit to the headquarters of United Nations Organization in New York, I used the expression \"family of nations\". I pointed out that: \"the ideal of 'family' immediately evokes something more than simple functional relations or a mere convergence of interests. The family is by nature a community based on mutual trust, mutual support and sincere respect. In an authentic family the strong do not dominate; instead, the weaker members, because of their very weakness, are all the more welcomed and served\" (Address to the Fiftieth General Assembly of the United Nations Organization, 5 October 1995, No. 14).</p>\n<p>This is the true meaning of what international law proposes in theory as the concept of \"reciprocity\". Each people must be ready to accept the identity of its neighbour: this is the exact opposite of the despotic nationalistic ideologies which have torn apart Europe and Africa, and continue to do so! Each nation must be prepared to share its human, spiritual and material resources in order to help those whose needs are greater than the needs of its own members. Rome is preparing to host next November the World Summit on Food, called by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. I hope its work will be inspired by a sense of solidarity and sharing, especially as 1996 has been declared by the United Nations Organization the \"Year for the Eradication of Poverty\".</p>\n<p>9. Recognition of others and of their heritage, this latter term being understood in a broad sense, is obviously applicable as well to a specific area of human rights: that of freedom of conscience and of religion. In fact I consider it my duty to return once more to this fundamental aspect of the spiritual life of millions of men and women, for the situation — and I say this with genuine sadness — is far from being satisfactory.</p>\n<p>Just as countries of Christian tradition welcome Muslim communities, certain countries with a Muslim majority also generously welcome non-Muslim communities, allowing them even to build their own places of worship and to live in those countries in accordance with their beliefs. Others however continue to practise discrimination against Jews, Christians and other religious groups, going even as far as to refuse them the right to meet in private for prayer. It cannot be said too often: this is an intolerable and unjustifiable violation not only of all the norms of current international law, but of the most fundamental human freedom, that of practising one's faith openly, which for human beings is their reason for living.</p>\n<p>In China and Vietnam, in contexts which are certainly different, Catholics face constant obstacles, especially with regard to the external manifestation of the bonds of communion with the Apostolic See.</p>\n<p>Millions of believers cannot be indefinitely oppressed, held in suspicion or divided among themselves, without this involving negative consequences not only for the international credibility of those States but also for the internal life of the societies concerned: a persecuted believer will always find it difficult to have confidence in a State which presumes to regulate his conscience. On the other hand, good relations between Churches and the State contribute to the harmony of all members of society.</p>\n<p>10. Ladies and Gentlemen, the purpose of these simple remarks has been to make the good wishes which we exchange more relevant. They have sketched a picture made up of lights and shadows, a reflection of the human soul.</p>\n<p>But it is the pressing duty of the Successor of Peter to remind national leaders, whom you so worthily represent here, that world stability cannot be achieved if certain values are disregarded, values such as respect for life, conscience, fundamental human rights, concern for the most needy, solidarity, to name but a few.</p>\n<p>The Holy See, being sovereign and independent among the nations, and for this reason a member of the international community, wishes to makes its specific contribution to this common commitment. Without political ambition, it is eager above all that humanity's path should be illuminated by the light of the One who, in coming into this world, became our travelling companion, the One \"in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge\" (Col 2:3).</p>\n<p>To him once more I commend your persons, your families and your nations, in particular the younger generation of whom I thought when I launched the appeal: \"Let us give children a future of peace!\" (Message for the Celebration of the World Day of Peace, 1 January 1996). Upon everyone, for the year now beginning, I invoke abundant divine blessings.</p>\n<p><i>Saturday, 13 January 1996</i></p>\n<hr>\n<p>*<i>L'Osservatore Romano.

Veuillez recevoir à votre tour les souhaits fervents que je forme pour que Dieu vous bénisse, avec vos familles et vos nations ; qu'Il accorde à tous une année heureuse!</font>\n<p></p>\n<p>C'est avec joie que je vois chaque année augmenter le nombre de pays qui entretiennent des relations diplomatiques avec le Saint-Siège. Ils sont aujourd'hui plus de cent soixante. Un tel développement nous paraît montrer la réelle considération que beaucoup portent au Siège apostolique et à sa mission au sein des nations. Cela constitue, pour le Pape et ses collaborateurs, un appel constant à coopérer toujours plus intensément avec le plus grand nombre de personnes et d'organisations qui, dans le respect de la morale et du droit, s'efforcent de faire en sorte que règnent sur notre terre la justice et la paix. C'est dire par là combien j'ai apprécié les paroles de Monsieur l'Ambassadeur Joseph Amichia qui, en votre nom, a bien voulu souligner quelques-unes des initiatives grâce auxquelles le Pape et, avec lui, le Saint-Siège se sont faits les interprètes de tous ceux qui dans le monde aspirent ardemment à la paix, à la sérénité et à la solidarité.</p>\n<p>2. Nous ne pouvons que nous réjouir aujourd'hui de voir ici, pour la première fois réunis le Représentant du Peuple palestinien. Depuis plus d'un an, comme vous le savez, le Saint-Siège entretient des relations diplomatiques avec l'État d'Israël. Nous attendions cet heureux état de choses, car il est le signe éloquent que le Moyen-Orient a résolument pris le chemin de la paix annoncée aux hommes par l'Enfant né à Bethléem. Veuille Dieu aider Israéliens et Palestiniens à vivre désormais les uns à côté des autres, les uns avec les autres, en paix, dans l'estime réciproque et dans une collaboration sincère ! Les générations futures le demandent et toute la région en bénéficiera.</p>\n<p>Mais laissez-moi vous confier que cette espérance pourrait se révéler éphémère s'il n'était pas donné aussi une solution équitable et adéquate au problème particulier de Jérusalem. La dimension religieuse et universelle de la Ville sainte réclame un engagement de toute la communauté internationale pour qu'elle conserve sa spécificité et qu'elle demeure une réalité vivante. Les Lieux saints, chers aux trois religions monothéistes, sont certes importants pour les croyants, mais ils perdraient beaucoup de leur signification s'ils n'étaient entourés de manière permanente par communautés actives de juifs, de chrétiens et de musulmans, jouissant d'une authentique liberté de conscience et de religion et développant leurs propres activités de caractère religieux, éducatif et social. L'année 1996 devrait voir commencer des négociations sur le statut définitif des territoires sous administration de l'Autorité nationale Palestinienne et également sur la délicate situation de la Ville de Jérusalem. Je souhaite que la Communauté internationale offre aux partenaires politiques plus directement concernés par ce problème des instruments juridiques et diplomatiques susceptibles d'assurer que Jérusalem, unique et sainte, soit vraiment un «carrefour de paix».</p>\n<p>Cette recherche sereine et résolue de la paix et de la fraternité contribuera sans nul doute à donner à d'autres problèmes régionaux persistants des solutions qui répondent aux aspirations de peuples encore inquiets sur leur sort et sur leur avenir. Je pense en particulier au Liban, dont la souveraineté reste menacée, et à l'Iraq, dont les populations attendent toujours de mener une existence normale, à l'abri de tout arbitraire.</p>\n<p>3. Un climat de paix semble également s'instaurer en certaines parties de l'Europe. La Bosnie-Herzégovine a pu bénéficier d'un accord qui devrait - nous l'espérons - sauvegarder sa physionomie tout en tenant compte de sa composition ethnique. Sarajevo en particulier, autre ville symbole, devrait devenir elle aussi un carrefour de paix. Ne l'appelle-t-on pas d'ailleurs la «Jérusalem d'Europe» ? Si le déclenchement de la première guerre mondiale est lié à cette ville, il faut que son nom devienne désormais synonyme de ville de la paix, et que les rencontres et les échanges culturels, sociaux et religieux, y fécondent la convivialité pluriethnique. Il s'agit d'un processus qui sera long et qui n'est pas sans difficultés. Je voudrais à ce sujet relever qu'une paix durable dans la région des Balkans ne pourra s'établir que si certaines conditions sont respectées : libre circulation des personnes et des idées ; libre retour des réfugiés dans leurs foyers ; préparation d'élections véritablement ?démocratiques ; et enfin une persévérante reconstruction matérielle et morale, à laquelle sont appelées à concourir sans réserve, non seulement la communauté internationale mais encore les Églises et les communautés religieuses. Si cette guerre, que j'ai souvent qualifiée d' «inutile», semble être terminée, l'œuvre de la paix à construire et à consolider apparaît comme un immense défi lancé en premier lieu aux Européens - mais pas à eux seuls -, afin que l'indifférence ou l'égoïsme n'en viennent pas à entraîner un pan entier de l'Europe dans un naufrage aux conséquences imprévisibles.</p>\n<p>L'Irlande du Nord continue, elle aussi, à cheminer vers un avenir plus serein et le processus en cours permet d'espérer une paix stable et durable. Tous sont désormais appelés à bannir à jamais deux maux qui ne sont point inéluctables : l'extrémisme sectaire et la violence politique. Puissent les catholiques et les protestants de cette terre se respecter, construire ensemble la paix et collaborer dans la vie quotidienne !</p>\n<p>Parmi les signes encourageants, je ne puis manquer d'évoquer l'évolution politique de l'Amérique du Sud, où vivent des populations majoritairement catholiques, dont la vitalité spirituelle constitue une richesse pour l'Église. De nombreux processus électoraux ont eu lieu ces mois derniers et se sont déroulés dans des conditions que les observateurs internationaux ont jugées normales. Mais les inégalités sociales sont encore très criantes et le problème de la production et du commerce de la drogue demeure irrésolu. Ce sont autant d'éléments qui doivent inciter les responsables politiques et économiques de ce continent à une gestion de la chose publique et de l'économie toujours plus attentive aux aspirations et aux nécessités réelles des populations. Ce type de conduite, ne l'oublions pas, a permis aux processus de paix en Amérique centrale de progresser. Au Nicaragua et au Salvador, les armes se sont tues. Au Guatemala, la réconciliation est en bonne voie. Certes, la cessation des hostilités ne signifie pas toujours la pacification de la société. La démilitarisation est difficile à imposer et le respect des droits de l'homme n'est pas total. Mais, là encore, un nouveau climat s'instaure peu à peu. Pour sa part, l'Église catholique ne manque pas d'y contribuer.</p>\n<p>Il faut que ce nouveau climat, porteur d'espérance, qui se développe grâce au travail acharné de négociateurs courageux auxquels va notre gratitude, ne soit pas seulement une trêve. Entre des extrémismes menaçants, la paix doit être une réalité. Et s'il en est ainsi, elle sera contagieuse.</p>\n<p>4. Mais il y a encore trop de foyers de conflits, plus ou moins larvés, qui tiennent des populations sous le joug insupportable de la violence, de la haine, de l'incertitude et de la mort.</p>\n<p>Je pense bien sûr, tout près de nous, à l'Algérie, où le sang coule presque tous les jours : nous ne pouvons que souhaiter ardemment voir enfin s'instaurer, dans le juste respect des différences, une logique de la concertation et un projet national où chacun puisse être tenu pour un partenaire.</p>\n<p>Toujours dans la région méditerranéenne, je voudrais mentionner une île divisée depuis 1974 : Chypre. Aucune solution n'a été encore trouvée. Une telle situation, qui empêche des populations séparées ou dépossédées de leurs biens de construire leur avenir, ne peut être maintenue indéfiniment. Que les négociations entre les parties concernées s'intensifient et soient animées d'une sincère volonté d'aboutir !</p>\n<p>La coopération en Méditerranée est un facteur indispensable à la stabilité et à la sécurité européennes, comme l'ont affirmé les participants au récent Sommet européen de Barcelone. Dans ce contexte, nous ne devons pas oublier les identités, les territoires et les voisinages, ainsi que les religions : autant d'éléments à concilier pour faire de cette zone un espace de coopération culturelle, religieuse et économique dont tous les peuples riverains ne pourraient que bénéficier.</p>\n<p>5. Si nous portons notre regard vers l'Orient, nous devons encore constater, hélas, que les combats se poursuivent en Tchétchénie. L'Afghanistan est toujours dans une impasse politique, tandis que la population se trouve traitée sans respect et plongée dans la plus grande détresse. Au Cachemire et au Sri Lanka, les combats ont continué à décimer les populations civiles. Les habitants du Timor-Oriental continuent eux aussi à attendre des propositions susceptibles de permettre la réalisation de leurs légitimes aspirations à voir reconnaître leur spécificité culturelle et religieuse. </p>\n<p>Il faut admirer et soutenir le courage de tant d'hommes et de femmes qui parviennent à sauver l'identité de leurs peuples et qui transmettent aux jeunes générations le flambeau de la mémoire et de l'espérance. </p>\n<p>6. Nous tournant vers l'Afrique, nous sommes contraints de déplorer la persistance de foyers de guerre et de conflits ethniques qui constituent un handicap permanent pour le développement du continent. La situation au Libéria ou en Somalie, que l'aide internationale n'a pas encore réussi à pacifier, demeure régie par la loi de la violence et des intérêts particuliers. Une action armée diffuse a plongé aussi la Sierra Leone dans un climat de tension, aggravant l'insécurité. Le Sud-Soudan reste une région où le dialogue et la négociation n'ont pas droit de cité. Nous aimerions également pouvoir constater des progrès plus décisifs en Angola, où les antagonismes politiques et la décomposition sociale empêchent de parler de normalisation. Le Rwanda et le Burundi sont encore tentés par un repli ethnico-nationaliste, dont les populations ont pourtant éprouvé les tragiques conséquences.</p>\n<p>L'an passé, en pareille occasion, j'avais sollicité un peu plus de solidarité internationale pour l'Afrique et, dans les circonstances présentes, je ne puis que renouveler instamment cet appel. Mais, aujourd'hui, je voudrais m'adresser tout particulièrement à la conscience des responsables politiques africains : si vous ne vous engagez pas plus résolument en faveur d'un dialogue national démocratique, si vous ne respectez pas plus nettement les droits de l'homme, si vous ne gérez pas de manière rigoureuse les fonds publics et les crédits extérieurs, si vous ne dénoncez pas l'idéologie ethnique, le continent africain demeurera toujours en marge dans la communauté des nations. Pour être aidés, les gouvernements africains doivent être politiquement crédibles. Les Évêques africains réunis en Assemblée spéciale du Synode des Évêques ont souligné l'urgence d'une bonne gestion des affaires publiques et de la bonne formation de responsables politiques - hommes et femmes - qui «aiment leur peuple jusqu'au bout et qui désirent servir plutôt que se servir» (Cf. Exhort. apost. <i> <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_jp-ii_exh_14091995_ecclesia-in-africa_fr.html\"> Ecclesia in Africa</a></i>, n. 111). </p>\n<p>7. Ces situations de conflit, auxquelles je viens de faire brièvement allusion, ne sont pas des fatalités. Les développements positifs qu'ont connus certaines régions, prises elles aussi dans les filets de la violence, montrent qu'il est possible de retrouver la confiance en l'autre, qui est en réalité confiance en la vie. La paix assurée et courageusement sauvegardée est victoire sur les forces de mort toujours à l'affût.</p>\n<p>Dans cet esprit, je ne puis qu'encourager la reprise des travaux à Genève, dans quelques jours, de la Conférence de révision de la Convention sur les armes conventionnelles causant des souffrances excessives, et la conclusion, au cours de l'année 1996, du traité sur l'interdiction des essais nucléaires. À cet égard, le Saint-Siège est d'avis que, dans le domaine des armes nucléaires, l'arrêt des essais et du perfectionnement de ces armes, le désarmement et la non-prolifération sont intimement liés et doivent être au plus tôt réalisés sous un contrôle international effectif. Ce sont là des étapes vers un désarmement général et complet auquel la Communauté internationale dans son ensemble devrait parvenir sans retard.</p>\n<p>8. Comme j'ai eu l'occasion de le rappeler plusieurs fois, ce que la Communauté internationale rassemble, ce ne sont pas seulement des États mais des Nations, formées d'hommes et de femmes qui tissent une histoire personnelle et collective. Ce sont leurs droits qu'il s'agit de définir et de garantir. Mais il faut, à l'image de ce qui se passe dans une famille, les nuancer en rappelant l'importance des devoirs corrélatifs. À l'occasion de ma récente visite au siège des Nations Unies à New York, j'ai employé l'expression de «famille des nations». Je faisais alors remarquer que «le concept de \"famille\" évoque immédiatement quelque chose qui va au-delà des seuls rapports fonctionnels et de la seule convergence des intérêts. Par sa nature, la famille est une communauté fondée sur la confiance réciproque, sur le soutien mutuel, sur le respect sincère. Dans une famille authentique, il n'y a pas de domination des forts : au contraire, les membres les plus faibles sont, précisément en raison de leur faiblesse, doublement accueillis et servis» (<a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1995/october/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_05101995_address-to-uno_fr.html\"><i>Discours à l'Assemblée générale</i>, 5 octobre 1995</a>, n. 14).</p>\n<p>C'est le vrai sens de ce que le droit international érige en théorie, par la notion de «réciprocité». Chaque peuple doit être disposé à accueillir l'identité de son voisin : nous sommes aux antipodes des nationalismes dominateurs qui ont déchiré et déchirent encore l'Europe et l'Afrique ! Chaque nation doit être prête à partager ses ressources humaines, spirituelles et matérielles pour venir en aide à ceux qui sont plus démunis que ses membres. Rome se prépare justement à accueillir, en novembre prochain, le Sommet mondial de l'alimentation, convoqué par la l'Organisation pour l'Alimentation et l'Agriculture. Je souhaite que le sens de la solidarité et du partage inspire ses travaux, d'autant plus que 1996 a été décrétée par l'Organisation des Nations Unies «année de l'éradication de la pauvreté».</p>\n<p>9. La reconnaissance de l'autre et de son patrimoine, ce dernier terme étant entendu dans son sens large, s'applique évidemment aussi à un domaine particulier des droits de la personne humaine : celui de la liberté de conscience et de religion. Je considère en effet de mon devoir de revenir une fois de plus sur cet aspect fondamental de la vie spirituelle de millions d'hommes et de femmes, car la situation - et je le dis avec une réelle tristesse - est loin d'être satisfaisante.</p>\n<p>Comme les pays de tradition chrétienne accueillent les communautés musulmanes, certains pays à majorité musulmane accueillent eux aussi généreusement les communautés non islamiques, leur permettant même de construire leurs propres édifices cultuels et d'y vivre selon leur foi. D'autres, cependant, continuent à pratiquer une discrimination à l'égard des juifs, des chrétiens et d'autres familles religieuses, allant jusqu'à leur refuser le droit de se réunir en privé pour prier. On ne le dira jamais assez : il s'agit là d'une violation intolérable et injustifiable non seulement de toutes les normes internationales en vigueur, mais de la liberté humaine la plus fondamentale, celle de manifester sa foi, qui est pour l'être humain sa raison de vivre.</p>\n<p>En Chine et au Viêt-Nam, dans des contextes certes différents, les catholiques sont en butte à des obstacles constants, surtout en ce qui regarde la manifestation visible du lien de communion avec le Siège apostolique.</p>\n<p>On ne peut indéfiniment opprimer des millions de croyants, les soupçonner ou les diviser sans que cela entraîne des conséquences négatives, non seulement sur la crédibilité internationale de ces États, mais aussi à l'intérieur même des sociétés concernées : un croyant persécuté aura toujours de la peine à faire confiance à l'État qui entend régenter sa conscience. Au contraire, de bons rapports entre les Églises et l'État contribuent à l'harmonie de tous les membres de la société.</p>\n<p>10. Mesdames, Messieurs, ces simples réflexions avaient pour but d'actualiser les vœux que nous échangeons. Elles ont tracé un cadre fait de lumières et d'ombres, à l'image de l'âme humaine.</p>\n<p>Mais c'est l'impérieux devoir du Successeur de Pierre que de rappeler aux responsables des nations, que vous représentez ici avec compétence, que la stabilité mondiale ne peut faire l'économie de certaines valeurs telles que le respect de la vie, de la conscience, des droits humains les plus fondamentaux, de l'attention aux plus démunis, de la solidarité, pour n'en citer que quelques-unes.</p>\n<p>Le Saint-Siège, souverain et indépendant parmi les nations et, pour cela, membre de la Communauté internationale, désire offrir sa contribution spécifique à cet engagement commun. Sans ambition politique, il est soucieux avant tout que le chemin de l'humanité soit éclairé par la lumière de Celui qui, en venant en ce monde, s'est fait notre compagnon de route, lui «en qui sont cachés les trésors de la sagesse et de la connaissance» (<i>Col</i> 2, 3).</p>\n<p>À Lui, une nouvelle fois, je confie vos personnes, vos familles et vos nations, en particulier les jeunes générations auxquelles j'ai pensé en lançant cet appel : «Donnons aux enfants un avenir de paix» (<a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/messages/peace/documents/hf_jp-ii_mes_08121995_xxix-world-day-for-peace_fr.html\"><i>Message pour la célébration de la Journée mondiale de la paix</i>, 1<sup>er</sup> janvier 1996</a>) !
