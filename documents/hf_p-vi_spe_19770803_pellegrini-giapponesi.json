We are very pleased to have the group from Fukuoka.</p>\n<p>You have come to Rome to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of your Diocese. And we hope that your pilgrimage will be the occasion for fresh vigour and renewed fervour in Christian living. We are confident that you will indeed fulfil the aim of your Jubilee celebration: to know Christ more and to make him more known.</p>\n<p>On our part we render homage to the memory of those generous missionaries who preached to you the Gospel of salvation and established the Church in your midst. Above all we give praise and thanks “to God who gives the growth” (1 <i> Cor</i>. 3, 7). Our prayer today is that you will be faithful for ever in your vocation of authentic Christian example and service, so that your fellowmen “may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven” (<i>Matth</i>. 5, 16).</p>\n<p>We also welcome the group of Franciscan Sisters journeying to Poland to honour Blessed Maximilian Kolbe. May your whole lives be inspired by the ardour of his Christian charity and the example of his selfless generosity.</p>\n<p>To all of you we impart our Apostolic Blessing, invoking upon you peace and joy in Christ.</p>\n<p><font face=\"Times\">                          </font></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
