Public lectures, circulating libraries, the Dowry of Mary pilgrimage and, above all, the publication of easily available pamphlets on doctrinal and devotional subjects, have been the outstanding achievements of the Society, to which We are especially grateful for the careful translation and wide diffusion of pontifical and conciliar documents, as well as of the books of Sacred Scripture. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> The sincerest judgement on the meritorious success of the Catholic Truth Society is manifested by the foundation of similar associations in other English-speaking countries of the world, which following the programme of your institution, have reaped rich harvests of spiritual enlightenment and grace. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> With fervent prayer to God that He may foster and fecundate the work of the Society for a new century of growth and accomplishment, We gratefully impart to you, Beloved Son, to the English and Welsh Hierarchy as Vice-Presidents, to the officers and members of the Society and the Box Tenders, as well as to all the priests and faithful who collaborate so generously with you, Our particular affectionate Apostolic Blessing. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <i>From the Vatican, October 18, 1968. </i> </p>\n<p align=\"center\"> <b>PAULUS PP.
