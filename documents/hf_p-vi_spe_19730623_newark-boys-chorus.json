You can actually help your fellowmen to lift up their hearts to spiritual values, and to come into closer contact with the beauty of God’s creation. </p>\n<p>We wish you success in your singing and success in your entire lives. We hope that your spirit of generosity will continue, that your enthusiasm and love will grow, and that the guiding principles of your lives will unite you ever more closely in true brotherhood under God our Father.</p>\n<p>                          </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
