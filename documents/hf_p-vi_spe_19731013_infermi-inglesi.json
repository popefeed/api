We are glad to have this opportunity of reminding you how much you can do for God’s Church: by accepting your sufferings, you can be a powerful source of grace for many-for people whom you may never meet in this world. This is part of God’s loving providence, and you should be encouraged by this thought to unite yourselves more and more each day with the mysterious divine will. It is our hope also that this visit to Rome will be a special occasion of grace and joy for all of you. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\"> At the same time we are pleased to express our satisfaction at the work being carried out by the Trust, in making possible visits to Lourdes for those who otherwise would never be able to make the journey. This is indeed a worthy undertaking, and a practical manifestation of Christian love and concern for others. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\"> While we assure you of our prayers, we cordially impart to each one of you, as well as to your families and friends at home, our special Apostolic Blessing.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <font face=\"Times\">                                   </font></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
