The word of God should be available at all times . . . And if, given the opportunity and the approval of Church authority, . . . translations are produced in cooperation with the separated brethren as well, all Christians will be able to use them» (<i><a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html\">Dei Verbum</a></i>, 22) - which is a highly desirable consequence. </p>\n<p>«Furthermore», the Council decreed, «editions of the sacred Scriptures, provided with suitable comments, should be prepared also for the use, of non-Christians and adapted to their situation. Both pastors of souls, and Christians generally, should see to the wise distribution of these editions in one way or another». Finally, the Fathers affirmed, «Just as the life of the Church grows through persistent participation in the Eucharistic mystery, so we may hope for a new surge of a spiritual vitality from intensified veneration for God’s word, which “lasts forever”» (<i>ibid</i>., 25-26). </p>\n<p>We therefore express to you Our heartfelt thanks for the valuable aid you have given in this important work, and to you, your families and religious communities, your collaborators and supporters, We gladly impart Our special paternal Apostolic Blessing.</p>\n<p>   </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
