Indeed information already reaching Us affords gratifying proof of the earnestness of its generous, zealous leaders. This confidence has now been increased by the assurance Your Excellency gives that American Relief for Italy Inc., has accomplished much and we express the hope that, under the able and enlightened leadership of Your Excellency, other governmental and benevolent organizations will lend their hearty cooperation to further the most praiseworthy aims of this National Agency. </p>\n<p>While then We implore the most plentiful blessings of God on the united efforts of all concerned with these noble enterprises, We voice the prayer that the work already begun may develop and grow apace and that it may serve to offer suffering peoples an unmistakable testimony of the active presence in the world of that Christian charity without which justice would be inadequate to ensure for mankind the inestimable gift of peace. </p>\n<p>We are happy on this occasion to renew the expression of Our sincere good wishes to Your Excellency.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><i>*Actes et Documents du Saint-Siège relatifs à la seconde guerre mondiale</i>, vol. 10 p.429-430.</p>\n<p><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></hr></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
