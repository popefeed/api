They are important for you and for God’s people on behalf of whom, like Christ, you have dedicated your lives. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\"> Through your study and fraternal exchanges, through your prayer and increased openness to God’s Word you are able to perceive more clearly the nature of Christ’s Church and his priesthood. And you are thus enabled to render an ever more committed and effective service in his name. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\"> Our prayer for you today is that it may indeed be so. With the Apostle Peter we say to you: \"Go on growing in the grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\" (<i>2 Petr</i>. 3, 18). And with the Apostle Paul we pray that the Lord will give you much joy and make your hearts strong so that you will \"never grow tired of doing what is right\" (<i>2 Thess</i>. 3, 13). In the name of Jesus we bless you and invoke upon you the grace of living and communicating his surpassing love.</font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <font face=\"Times\">                                       </font></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
