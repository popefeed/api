We think it is significant that you should make a pilgrimage to both Lourdes and Rome, for two prominent features of the faith of the Irish people are surely a special devotion to the Mother of God and a strong veneration for the See of Peter. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> We know that you come from the shrine of Lourdes refreshed by the prayerful contemplation of Mary Immaculate. We hope that also here in Rome you may derive abundant spiritual graces from visiting the tombs of the ApostIes and the many places sanctified by the blood of Christian martyrs. It is our earnest hope that through the deepening of your faith and the strengthening of your love for the Church of Christ you may give effective witness of true Christian living. To each of you and to your dear ones at home we cordially impart our Apostolic Blessing.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">                                                                                 </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
