Forced to forsake the land of their birth and seek on far-off, unfamiliar shores a refuge, where they might begin anew a family life, how many have then had to experience the almost desperate situation, added to their miseries, of not being welcome where they had hoped for hospitality. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> Your desire to visit Us this morning is a testimony to your confidence in the interest We have in the sad plight of peoples just described. Again and again, as did Our predecessor of happy memory before Us, We have strongly urged that fundamental principles of justice and charity and the long recognized practice of offering asylum to those not guilty of crime be the norm of government conduct today. It is a consolation to Our paternal heart to know that Our appeal has been generously heeded in many countries; and We like to cherish the hope that, so long as that evil blight perdures, States will not be lacking in their obligation to succour those who have been forced to emigrate. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> We have been happy to welcome you, gentlemen, and Our heart goes out in fervent prayer to God, that in His bounteous goodness He have pity on those who are suffering injustice and enlighten those who are perpetrating evil.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><i>*Discorsi e Radiomessaggi di Sua Santità Pio XII</i>, XIX, <br/>  Diciannovesimo anno di Pontificato, 2 marzo 1957-1° marzo 1958, p. <font face=\"Times New Roman\">289<br/> Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana</font></p>\n<p> </p>\n</hr></fine><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
