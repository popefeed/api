There can be no doubt that the ecumenical movements is a grace of God for our times, and we must thank God for the wonders he has already worked in this connection. At the same time, conscious of the difficulties that prevent us from reaching that full communion for which Our Lord prayed and anxious lest new obstacles arise, we likewise pray to be ever more faithful to this grace, so that the works of the Lord may be fulfiled in us. </p>\n<p><i>From the Vatican, 12 July 1988. </i></p>\n<p align=\"center\">IOANNES PAULUS PP.
