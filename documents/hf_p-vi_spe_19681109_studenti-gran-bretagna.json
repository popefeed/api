We regret the absence, due to illness, of your Chairman, Alderman Quilley, and send him best wishes for a rapid recovery. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> We thank you for your visit to Us, during your tour of Italy. Besides the natural beauties of the country, you have seen the works of art and architecture which are so numerous here. You have, no doubt, noticed how many of these are inspired by and dedicated to religious themes, the events of the life of Our Lord, of the Saints, and of the Church. Therefore We are confident that your visits will have not only a cultural value, but an elevating power to raise your minds and hearts to God. Who is infinite Truth and Beauty. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> It has been Our privilege in the past to visit your beautiful country, and We preserve many happy memories of the treasures of art and culture We saw there as well as of the kindness and courtesy of your people. Through you, We send them Our prayerful greetings and good wishes. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> We pray that you may derive lasting benefit from your journey, and return safely home to your families and friends. Upon you and them, and upon all those you hold dear, We invoke God’s richest blessings and graces of happiness and prosperity.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">                                              </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
