Under your chairman, Sir Frederick Warner, you represent nineteen countries of Europe at the highest levels of engineering skills, and your Federation groups more than seven hundred thousand members of your honoured profession. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> Today “men find that remarkable developments in technology and in scientific investigation . . . offer them readier opportunities for attaining their inheritance of intellectual and spiritual culture, and for fulfilling themselves, and one another, by forging stronger bonds between various groups and even whole peoples” (<i><a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651028_gravissimum-educationis_en.html\">Gravissimum educationis</a></i>, Introd.). Your activities can contribute greatly to strengthening such ties and to building new bridges between nations and races. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> We therefore wish you well in all of the important undertakings of your profession, so that men, through improved housing, roads and communications, and scientific advancement, may draw closer to each other as brothers, as sons of the same Father and Creator, for the good of all mankind. In that hope, We invoke upon you and your families, and upon all the engineers you so honourably represent, abundant divine graces of illumination and guidance.<font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\"> </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <font face=\"Times\">                                         </font></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
