It is only natural, then, that they should betray a lively joy and expectancy at the prospect of getting home. \n<p>You are going back to a great country; We cannot forget Our visit of ten years ago. It is great in its incomparable industrial power, greater still in the whole-souled, unselfish generosity of its people, and great, too, one cannot but feel, in the high destiny God has assigned to it. For wealth and power and virtue inevitably impose the heavy responsibility of leadership. And the world is looking, pleading, hoping to be led out of the morass of petty—but may they not become criminal—jealousies, recriminations, distrust, unholy ambitions, up on the plateau where the pure air blows freely for one and all mankind. Oh pray, as We pray every day, that the world may not see its hopes turn to ashes. </p>\n<p>And when life has again resumed its accustomed, even tenor for you in your native cities, may your memories of Rome be happy ones, refreshing, uplifting. May you still, at times at least, hear the far-off echo of those voices that rise from out of the hallowed shrines and sacred tombs and monuments which you have passed so often in this mother-city of Christian civilization, and find comfort and inspiration in their message, that Christ lives, Christ rules, and the union and peace men of good-will are searching for can be found if they would but rally in humble allegiance to His ennobling and imperishable standard. </p>\n<p>Tell America that We are consoled and grateful for all that is has done and is doing to alleviate the sufferings of the world. God's loving and potent blessing, which We, with paternal affection, invoke on you, your dear ones and all your countrymen, will be your rich reward.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><i>*Discorsi e Radiomessaggi di Sua Santità Pio XII</i>, VIII, <br/> Quinto anno di Pontificato, 2 marzo 1946 - 1° marzo 1947, p.123<font face=\"Times New Roman\"><br/> Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana</font></p>\n<p> </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></hr></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
