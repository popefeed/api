It must imply a sensitiveness, a delicate and determined adjustment of mind and heart to the Divine, as well as to the merely human, rights and interests that press f or recognition and protection during your days of labour and solicitude in the legislative chamber and administrative office, especially, may We not say, during these critical days of reconstruction, in the sector of international economy and finance. </p>\n<p> Thanks be, then, first and last to God; and as you bless Him for His gifts, you will affirm the worthy purpose to honour and revere His most holy will in your fulfilling of a sacred duty to your people. And to the end that you and all legislators may heed this call of a right conscience with courage and with constancy, We fondly invoke, for yourselves, Gentlemen, and your distinguished colleagues, for your children and your country, an ever more generous boon of light and strength from the heart of Him Who holds men and nations in the hollow of His omnipotent hand.</p>\n<hr>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>*Discorsi e Radiomessaggi di Sua Santità Pio XII</i>, XI, <br/> Undecimo anno di Pontificato, 2 marzo 1949 - 1° marzo 1950, pp. 297-298<br/> Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></hr></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
