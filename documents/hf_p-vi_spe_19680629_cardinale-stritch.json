This service of hospitality is in itself a merit, because of the comfort it offers, because of the community life it will provide priests from the same nation, and for the religious and ecclesiastical spirit which marks it. It is a beautiful work, worthy of the Catholic clergy of America, whom we know even under the aspect of personal home life, and of whose virtues we are aware: simplicity, brotherliness and piety.</p>\n<p>This house further creates a new bond, sympathetic and worthy of praise, between the Church in the United States and the Church of Rome; it confirms their fraternal ties; and it makes it easier for the priests, housed here, to appreciate their stay in Rome, the center of the Catholic Church. It also offers an occasion for the Roman clergy, for the Roman Curia and for Catholics, who reside here or who pass through this city, to know better and to appreciate more the spirit, the life and the work of American Catholicism. </p>\n<p>We express Our praise to all those who merit it for the completion of this residence: to Cardinal Cody, Archbishop of Chicago, first of all, as a promoter of this new house, and to the American Hierarchy through him, and to Monsignor Marcinkus, our dear and able collaborator in the Secretariat of State, who directed the execution of this work. We pray that a good ecclesiastical spirit will always form the atmosphere of this lodging, to which We give from Our heart Our blessing, which naturally extends itself to all those present, to the guests here now and those of tomorrow.</p>\n<p> </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
