Both are symbols and expression of the commitment we share to the cause of Christian unity, which must be the fruit of a growth both of mutual knowledge and mutual love. </font> </p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\"> We never cease to give thanks to our common Father for the grace of this hope and aspiration, and for the perseverance and wisdom he grants to those who pursue it. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\"> Some of you have been deeply engaged in this labour of knowledge and love from the beginning, all of you are now at one in this task. It is a joy for us to speak with you and to invoke the generous blessing of Almighty God on the work of the Centre and on that of the International Commission as it moves into an important phase in the search for organic unity. </font></p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <font face=\"Times\" size=\"3\">                                            </font></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div>\n</div>\n<!-- /TESTO -->\n<br style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<hr/>\n<p align=\"center\"><font color=\"#663300\">Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana</font></p>\n<!-- /CONTENUTO DOCUMENTO -->\n</div>"
