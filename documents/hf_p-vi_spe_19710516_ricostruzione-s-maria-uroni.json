We extend our congratulations to those who have promoted the restoration of this famous site. It was there that Jesuit pioneers, accompanied by generous lay persons, endeavoured to bring to the people whom they profoundly loved the faith which they themselves had received as a heritage. As We recall with admiration and gratitude these men of faith and the impressive chapter that they have written in the history of your country, We express Our confidence that their memory will indeed live on in the proud annals of the Canadian people."
